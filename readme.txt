TopicTracker v1.2

Changelog: 
- managed some more exceptions
- streamlined the NLP pipeline
- optimized details here and there

To do in v1.3: 
- understand why the PubMed APIs work so strangely with the PDAT tag (that is what produces lots of duplicates)
- manage exceptions (=empty files) in the tabs of notebook 3
- optimize the creation of the medline file in notebook 1
