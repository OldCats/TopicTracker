AB  - Having multiple dimensions, uncertainties and several stakeholders, the costly
      pharmacogenomics (PGx) is associated with dynamic implementation complexities.
      Identification of these challenges is critical to harness its full potential,
      especially in developing countries with fragile healthcare systems and scarce
      resources. This is the first study aimed to identify most salient challenges
      related to PGx implementation, with respect to the experiences of early-adopters 
      and local experts' prospects, in the context of a developing country in the
      Middle East. To perform a comprehensive reconnaissance on PGx adoption challenges
      a scoping literature review was conducted based on national drug policy
      components: efficacy/safety, access, affordability and rational use of medicine
      (RUM). Strategic option development and analysis workshop method with cognitive
      mapping as the technique was used to evaluate challenges in the context of Iran. 
      The cognitive maps were face-validated and analyzed via Decision Explorer XML.
      The findings indicated a complex network of issues relative to PGx adoption,
      categorized in national drug policy indicators. In the rational use of medicine
      category, ethics, education, bench -to- bedside strategies, guidelines,
      compliance, and health system issues were found. Clinical trial issues, test's
      utility, and biomarker validation were identified in the efficacy group.
      Affordability included pricing, reimbursement, and value assessment issues.
      Finally, access category included regulation, availability, and stakeholder
      management challenges. The current study identified the most significant
      challenges ahead of clinical implementation of PGx in a developing country. This 
      could be the basis of a policy-note development in future work, which may
      consolidate vital communication among stakeholders and accelerate the efficient
      implementation in developing new-comer countries.

TI  - Improving the support for XML dynamic updates using a hybridization labeling
      scheme (ORD-GAP).
PG  - 907
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.69108.1 [doi]
AB  - Background : As the standard for the exchange of data over the World Wide Web, it
      is important to ensure that the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) database is
      capable of supporting not only efficient query processing but also capable of
      enduring frequent data update operations over the dynamic changes of Web content.
      Most of the existing XML annotation is based on a labeling scheme to identify
      each hierarchical position of the XML nodes. This computation is costly as any
      updates will cause the whole XML tree to be re-labelled. This impact can be
      observed on large datasets. Therefore, a robust labeling scheme that avoids
      re-labeling is crucial. Method: Here, we present ORD-GAP (named after Order Gap),
      a robust and persistent XML labeling scheme that supports dynamic updates.
      ORD-GAP assigns unique identifiers with gaps in-between XML nodes, which could
      easily identify the level, Parent-Child (P-C), Ancestor-Descendant (A-D) and
      sibling relationship. ORD-GAP adopts the OrdPath labeling scheme for any future
      insertion. Results: We demonstrate that ORD-GAP is robust enough for dynamic
      updates, and have implemented it in three use cases: (i) left-most, (ii)
      in-between and (iii) right-most insertion. Experimental evaluations on DBLP
      dataset demonstrated that ORD-GAP outperformed existing approaches such as
      ORDPath and ME Labeling concerning database storage size, data loading time and
      query retrieval. On average, ORD-GAP has the best storing and query retrieval
      time. Conclusion: The main contributions of this paper are: (i) A robust labeling
      scheme named ORD-GAP that assigns certain gap between each node to support future
      insertion, and (ii) An efficient mapping scheme, which built upon ORD-GAP
      labeling scheme to transform XML into RDB effectively.

TI  - Listening to your mass spectrometer: An open-source toolkit to visualize mass
      spectrometer data.
PG  - 44-49
LID - 10.1016/j.jmsacl.2021.12.003 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: We have developed a set of tools built with open-source software
      that includes both a database and a visualization component to collect LC-MS/MS
      data and monitor quality control parameters. Description of tool: To display
      LC-MS/MS data we built a parsing tool using Python and standard libraries to
      parse the XML files after each clinical run. The tool parses the necessary
      information to store a database comprised of three distinct tables. Another
      component to this toolkit is an interactive data visualization tool that uses the
      data from the database. There are 5 different visualizations that present the
      data based on interchangeable parameters. Evaluation of tool: Using histogram
      visualization, we assessed how quality control parameters that feed our quality
      control algorithm, SMACK, which assists to improve the efficiency of data review 
      and results, performed against the collective data. Using the newly identified QC
      parameter values from the toolkit, we compared the output of the SMACK algorithm;
      the number of QC flags changed in that there was a 1.7% (31/1944 observations)
      increase in flags and a 7.1% (138/1944 observations) decrease in presumed false
      positive flags, increasing the overall performance of SMACK which helped staff
      focus their time on reviewing more concerning QC failures. Discussion: We have
      developed a customizable web-based dashboard for instrument performance
      monitoring for our opiate confirmation LC-MS/MS assay using data collected with
      each batch. The web-based platform allows users to monitor instrument performance
      and can encompass other instruments throughout the laboratory. This information
      can help the laboratory take proactive measures to maintain instruments,
      ultimately reducing the amount down time needed for maintenance.

AB  - Integration between information systems is critical, especially in the healthcare
      domain, since interoperability requirements are related to patients' data
      confidentiality, safety, and satisfaction. The goal of this study is to propose a
      solution based on the integration between queue management solution (QMS) and the
      electronic medical records (EMR), using Health Level Seven (HL7) protocols and
      Extensible Markup Language (XML). The proposed solution facilitates the patient's
      self-check-in within a healthcare organization in UAE. The solution aims to help 
      in minimizing the waiting times within the outpatient department through early
      identification of patients who hold the Emirates national ID cards, i.e., whether
      an Emirati or expatriates. The integration components, solution design, and the
      custom-designed XML and HL7 messages were clarified in this paper. In addition,
      the study includes a simulation experiment through control and intervention weeks
      with 517 valid appointments. The experiment goal was to evaluate the patient's
      total journey and each related clinical stage by comparing the "routine-based
      identification" with the "patient's self-check-in" processes in case of booked
      appointments. As a key finding, the proposed solution is efficient and could
      reduce the "patient's journey time" by more than 14 minutes and "time to
      identify" patients by 10 minutes. There was also a significant drop in the
      waiting time to triage and the time to finish the triage process. In conclusion, 
      the proposed solution is considered innovative and can provide a positive added
      value for the patient's whole journey.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Traditional Chinese Medicine Injections for Heart Failure 
      With Reduced Ejection Fraction: A Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized
      Controlled Trials.
PG  - 659707
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.659707 [doi]
AB  - Background: Heart failure as an important issue in global public health, has
      brought a heavy economic burden. Traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) 
      have significant effects on heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
      However, it is difficult for clinicians to identify the differences in clinical
      efficacy and safety of various TCMIs. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of various TCMIs for treating HFrEF by conducting a Bayesian 
      network meta-analysis (NMA) and to further provide references for clinical
      decision-making. Methods: The clinical randomized controlled trials of TCMIs for 
      treating HFrEF were searched in seven database from inception to August 3rd,
      2021. The Cochrane collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias. NMA 
      was performed in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. The surface under the
      cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), the multi-dimensional efficacy analysis, the
      comparison-adjusted funnel plot, and the node-splitting analysis were conducted
      using R software. Results: A total of 107 eligible RCTs involving 9,073 HFrEF
      patients and 6 TCMIs were included. TCMIs include Huangqi injection (HQ) also
      called Astragalus injection, Shenfu injection (SF), Shengmai injection (SGM),
      Shenmai injection (SM), Xinmailong injection (XML), and Yiqifumai lyophilized
      injection (YQFM). The results of NMA and SUCRA showed that with conventional
      treatment (CT) as a common control, in terms of clinical efficacy, CT + XML was
      most effective in New York Heart Association cardiac functional classification
      efficiency, brain natriuretic peptide, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
      peptide; the CT + SM was most effective in 6-min walking test, left ventricular
      end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter and cardiac
      output; the CT + YQFM was most effective in left ventricular ejection fraction;
      the CT + HQ was most effective in stroke volume; the CT + SF was most effective
      in Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. In terms of safety, there
      was no significant difference between CT + TCMIs and CT. Conclusion: This
      Bayesian network meta-analysis results show that the combination of qualified
      TCMIs and CT is more effective for HFrEF patients than CT alone, and CT + XML and
      CT + SM may be one of the potential optimal treatments. Also, the safety of these
      TCMIs needs to be further observed. However, due to some limitations, the
      conclusions need to be verified by more large-sample, double-blind, multi-center 
      RCTs.

TI  - EnzymeML-a data exchange format for biocatalysis and enzymology.
LID - 10.1111/febs.16318 [doi]
AB  - EnzymeML is an XML-based data exchange format that supports the comprehensive
      documentation of enzymatic data by describing reaction conditions, time courses
      of substrate and product concentrations, the kinetic model, and the estimated
      kinetic constants. EnzymeML is based on the Systems Biology Markup Language,
      which was extended by implementing the STRENDA Guidelines. An EnzymeML document
      serves as a container to transfer data between experimental platforms, modeling
      tools, and databases. EnzymeML supports the scientific community by introducing a
      standardized data exchange format to make enzymatic data findable, accessible,
      interoperable, and reusable according to the FAIR data principles. An application
      programming interface in Python supports the integration of software tools for
      data acquisition, data analysis, and publication. The feasibility of a seamless
      data flow using EnzymeML is demonstrated by creating an EnzymeML document from a 
      structured spreadsheet or from a STRENDA DB database entry, by kinetic modeling
      using the modeling platform COPASI, and by uploading to the enzymatic reaction
      kinetics database SABIO-RK.

TI  - Control and Diagnostics System Generator for Complex FPGA-Based Measurement
      Systems.
LID - 7378 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s21217378 [doi]
AB  - FPGA-based data acquisition and processing systems play an important role in
      modern high-speed, multichannel measurement systems, especially in High-Energy
      and Plasma Physics. Such FPGA-based systems require an extended control and
      diagnostics part corresponding to the complexity of the controlled system.
      Managing the complex structure of registers while keeping the tight coupling
      between hardware and software is a tedious and potentially error-prone process.
      Various existing solutions aimed at helping that task do not perfectly match all 
      specific requirements of that application area. The paper presents a new solution
      based on the XML system description, facilitating the automated generation of the
      control system's HDL code and software components and enabling easy integration
      with the control software. The emphasis is put on reusability, ease of
      maintenance in the case of system modification, easy detection of mistakes, and
      the possibility of use in modern FPGAs. The presented system has been
      successfully used in data acquisition and preprocessing projects in high-energy
      physics experiments. It enables easy creation and modification of the control
      system definition and convenient access to the control and diagnostic blocks. The
      presented system is an open-source solution and may be adopted by the user for
      particular needs.

TI  - The effect of curculigo orchioides (Xianmao) on kidney energy metabolism and the 
      related mechanism in rats based on metabolomics.
PG  - 6194-6212
LID - 10.1002/fsn3.2573 [doi]
AB  - The Chinese materia medica Xianmao (XM) is widely used in Chinese clinics and the
      traditional Chinese medicine diets. Although XM is often used to study its
      kidney-yang effect, the research on its effect on kidney energy metabolism and
      its mechanism is still relatively lacking. In this study, rats were given
      different doses of XM water extract for 4 weeks. Biochemical method was used to
      detect the content of serum biochemical indexes of liver and kidney function and 
      blood lipid indicators, and HE staining method was used to observe the
      histopathological of liver and kidney in rats. The kidney Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase,
      Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase, SDH (succinate dehydrogenase) enzyme activity, and the
      content of ATP in rats were measured. Metabolomics technology was used to analyze
      the potential biomarkers related to the effects of XM on kidney energy
      metabolism, and then, the metabolic pathways were analyzed. RT-PCR was used to
      detect the expression of Ampk, Sirt1, Ppar-alpha, and Pgc-1alpha mRNA in kidney
      of rats. The results showed, compared with the blank control group, there was no 
      significant effect on liver and kidney function in XMH, XMM, and XML groups.
      These significantly increased the kidney Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-ATPase,
      SDH enzyme activity, and ATP content in XMH, XMM, and XML groups. Mitochondrial
      metabolic rate was inhibited in XMH group, but it was significantly increased in 
      XMM and XML groups. The number of mitochondria was increased in XMH, XMM, and XML
      groups. Overall, these effects may be mediated by TCA cycle metabolism, butanoate
      metabolism, propanoate metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, 
      retinol metabolism, purine metabolism, pentose phosphate metabolism,
      aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, and
      degradation metabolism pathways, as well as by increasing expression of upstream 
      genes Ampk, Sirt1, Ppar-alpha, and Pgc-1alpha mRNA.

TI  - Construction of an N6-methyladenosine lncRNA- and immune cell
      infiltration-related prognostic model in colorectal cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s00709-021-01718-x [doi]
AB  - The present paper aims to shed light on the influence of N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
      long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and immune cell infiltration on colorectal cancer 
      (CRC). We downloaded workflow-type data and xml-format clinical data on CRC from 
      The Cancer Genome Atlas project. The relationship between lncRNA and m6A was
      identified by using Perl and R software. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      enrichment analysis was performed. Lasso regression was utilized to construct a
      prognostic model. Survival analysis was used to explore the relationship between 
      clusters of m6A lncRNAs and clinical survival data. Differential analysis of the 
      tumor microenvironment and an immune correlation analysis were used to determine 
      immune cell infiltration levels in different clusters and their correlation with 
      clinical prognosis. The expression of lncRNA was tightly associated with m6A. The
      univariate Cox regression analysis showed that lncRNA was a risk factor for the
      prognosis. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that m6A lncRNAs were
      partially highly expressed in tumor tissue. m6A lncRNA-related prognostic model
      could predict the prognosis of CRC independently. "ECM_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION" was 
      the most significantly enriched gene set. PARP8 was overexpressed in tumor tissue
      and high-risk cluster. CD4 memory T cells, activated resting NK cells, and memory
      B cells were highly clustered in the high-risk cluster. All of the scores were
      higher in the low-risk group. m6A lncRNA is closely related to the occurrence and
      progression of CRC. The corresponding prognostic model can be utilized to
      evaluate the prognosis of CRC. m6A lncRNA and related immune cell infiltration in
      the tumor microenvironment can provide novel therapeutic targets for further
      research.

TI  - Software review: The JATSdecoder package-extract metadata, abstract and sectioned
      text from NISO-JATS coded XML documents; Insights to PubMed central's open access
      database.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s11192-021-04162-z [doi]
AB  - JATSdecoder is a general toolbox which facilitates text extraction and analytical
      tasks on NISO-JATS coded XML documents. Its function JATSdecoder() outputs
      metadata, the abstract, the sectioned text and reference list as easy selectable 
      elements. One of the biggest repositories for open access full texts covering
      biology and the medical and health sciences is PubMed Central (PMC), with more
      than 3.2 million files. This report provides an overview of the PMC document
      collection processed with JATSdecoder(). The development of extracted tags is
      displayed for the full corpus over time and in greater detail for some meta tags.
      Possibilities and limitations for text miners working with scientific literature 
      are outlined. The NISO-JATS-tags are used quite consistently nowadays and allow a
      reliable extraction of metadata and text elements. International collaborations
      are more present than ever. There are obvious errors in the date stamps of some
      documents. Only about half of all articles from 2020 contain at least one author 
      listed with an author identification code. Since many authors share the same
      name, the identification of person-related content is problematic, especially for
      authors with Asian names. JATSdecoder() reliably extracts key metadata and text
      elements from NISO-JATS coded XML files. When combined with the rich, publicly
      available content within PMCs database, new monitoring and text mining approaches
      can be carried out easily. Any selection of article subsets should be carefully
      performed with in- and exclusion criteria on several NISO-JATS tags, as both the 
      subject and keyword tags are used quite inconsistently.

TI  - Evaluation of JATSdecoder as an automated text extraction tool for statistical
      results in scientific reports.
PG  - 19525
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-98782-3 [doi]
AB  - The extraction of statistical results in scientific reports is beneficial for
      checking studies on plausibility and reliability. The R package JATSdecoder
      supports the application of text mining approaches to scientific reports. Its
      function get.stats() extracts all reported statistical results from text and
      recomputes p values for most standard test results. The output can be reduced to 
      results with checkable or computable p values only. In this article,
      get.stats()'s ability to extract, recompute and check statistical results is
      compared to that of statcheck, which is an already established tool. A manually
      coded data set, containing the number of statistically significant results in 49 
      articles, serves as an initial indicator for get.stats()'s and statcheck's
      differing detection rates for statistical results. Further 13,531 PDF files by 10
      mayor psychological journals, 18,744 XML documents by Frontiers of Psychology and
      23,730 articles related to psychological research and published by PLoS One are
      scanned for statistical results with both algorithms. get.stats() almost
      replicates the manually extracted number of significant results in 49 PDF
      articles. get.stats() outperforms the statcheck functions in identifying
      statistical results in every included journal and input format. Furthermore, the 
      raw results extracted by get.stats() increase statcheck's detection rate.
      JATSdecoder's function get.stats() is a highly general and reliable tool to
      extract statistical results from text. It copes with a wide range of textual
      representations of statistical standard results and recomputes p values for two- 
      and one-sided tests. It facilitates manual and automated checks on consistency
      and completeness of the reported results within a manuscript.

TI  - Could computed tomography histogram analysis add value to the diagnosis of
      cholesteatoma.
LID - 10.3906/sag-2105-12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To investigate the potential role of computed tomography (CT)
      histogram analysis in differentiating cholesteatoma (CHS) and non-cholesteatoma
      (NCHS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 77 temporal bone CT images (from
      November 2016 to February 2020) that were obtained pre-operatively (mean age,
      37.10+/-17.27 years in CHS; 36.72+/-16.08 years in NCHS group). Histogram
      analyses of the resulting XML files were conducted using the R Project 3.3.2
      program. ROC analysis was used to find threshold values and the diagnostic
      efficiency of these values in differentiating CHS-NCHS was determined. RESULTS:
      The CT images of 41 CHS (53.25%) and 36 NHCS cases (46.75%) were evaluated. There
      was a statistically significant difference between the CHS and NCHS group in
      terms of the mean, maximum, and median values ( P=0.036, P=0.006, P=0.043). When 
      examining the ROC curve obtained from the mean of these parameters, area under
      the curve (AUC)=0.638, and when the threshold value is selected as 42.55, the
      mean value was determined to have a sensitivity of 86.50% and specificity of
      56.10% in differentiating CHS-NCHS. CONCLUSION: In cases with magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) contraindications, small-sized lesions may be difficult to detect
      and characterize due to a poor resolution; to reduce the rate of false
      positives/negatives in these situations, CT histogram analysis of previously
      taken images may provide the additional information.

TI  - Computerized automated algorithm-based analyses of digitized paper ECGs in
      Brugada syndrome.
PG  - 61-66

LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2021.09.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome is a rare inherited arrhythmic syndrome with a coved
      type 1 ST-segment elevation on ECG and an increased risk of sudden death. Many
      studies have evaluated risk stratification performance based on ECG-derived
      parameters. However, since historical Brugada patient cohorts included mostly
      paper ECGs, most studies have been based on manual ECG parameter measurements. We
      hypothesized that it would be possible to run automated algorithm-based analysis 
      of paper ECGs. We aimed: 1) to validate the digitization process for paper ECGs
      in Brugada patients; and 2) to quantify the acute class I antiarrhythmic drug
      effect on relevant ECG parameters in Brugada syndrome. METHODS: A total of 176
      patients (30% female, 43 +/- 13 years old) with induced type 1 Brugada syndrome
      ECG were included in the study. All of the patients had paper ECGs before and
      during class I antiarrhythmic drug challenge. Twenty patients also had a digital 
      ECG, in whom printouts were used to validate the digitization process. Paper ECGs
      were scanned and then digitized using ECGScan software, version 3.4.0 (AMPS, LLC,
      New York, NY, USA) to obtain FDA HL7 XML format ECGs. Measurements were
      automatically performed using the Bravo (AMPS, LLC, New York, NY, USA) and
      Glasgow algorithms. RESULTS: ECG parameters obtained from digital and digitized
      ECGs were closely correlated (r = 0.96 +/- 0.07, R(2) = 0.93 +/- 0.12). Class I
      antiarrhythmic drugs significantly increased the global QRS duration (from 113
      +/- 20 to 138 +/- 23, p < 0.0001). On lead V2, class I antiarrhythmic drugs
      increased ST-segment elevation (from 110 +/- 84 to 338 +/- 227 muV, p < 0.0001), 
      decreased the ST slope (from 14.9 +/- 23.3 to -27.4 +/- 28.5, p < 0.0001) and
      increased the TpTe interval (from 88 +/- 18 to 104 +/- 33, p < 0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Automated algorithm-based measurements of depolarization and
      repolarization parameters from digitized paper ECGs are reliable and could
      quantify the acute effects of class 1 antiarrhythmic drug challenge in Brugada
      patients. Our results support using computerized automated algorithm-based
      analyses from digitized paper ECGs to establish risk stratification decision
      trees in Brugada syndrome.

TI  - ADT2FHIR - A Tool for Converting ADT/GEKID Oncology Data to HL7 FHIR Resources.
PG  - 104-110
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210547 [doi]
AB  - Harmonized and interoperable data management is a core requirement for federated 
      infrastructures in clinical research. Institutions participating in such
      infrastructures often have to invest large degrees of time and resources in
      implementing necessary data integration processes to convert their local data to 
      the required target structure. If the data is already available in an alternative
      shared data structure, the transformation from source to the desired target
      structure can be implemented once and then be distributed to all participants to 
      reduce effort and harmonize results. The HL7(R) FHIR(R) standard is used as a
      basis for the shared data model of several medical consortia like DKTK and GBA.
      It is based on so-called resources which can be represented in XML. Oncological
      data in German university hospitals is commonly available in the ADT/GEKID
      format. From this common basis we conceptualized and implemented a transformation
      which accepts ADT/GEKID XML files and returns FHIR resources. We identified
      several problems with using the general ADT/GEKID structure in federated research
      infrastructures, as well as some possible pitfalls relating to the FHIR need for 
      resource ids and focus on semantic coding which differs from the approach in the 
      ADT/GEKID standard. To facilitate participation in federated infrastructures, we 
      propose the ADT2FHIR transformation tool for partners with oncological data in
      the ADT/GEKID format.

TI  - Periplaneta americana extract ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury
      by improving mitochondrial dysfunction via the AMPK/PGC-1alpha signaling pathway.
PG  - 1138
LID - 10.3892/etm.2021.10572 [doi]
AB  - Periplaneta americana (PA) extract acts clinically as a therapeutic treatment in 
      various diseases; it enhances liver function in mouse models and mitigates the
      pathological condition of liver fibrosis. The present study aimed to investigate 
      the role and potential mechanisms underlying the action of the PA extract,
      xinmailong (XML), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury. Following the
      treatment of AML12 cells with LPS, the content of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm
      and mitochondria, and the level of ATP synthesis were detected using
      corresponding kits. The relative mRNA expression levels of nuclear respiratory
      factor 1 and transcription factor A, mitochondrial were investigated using
      reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR analysis. The MTT assay was
      performed to detect the viability of AML12 cells following treatment with XML, in
      the absence or presence of LPS. Western blot analysis was performed to determine 
      the expression levels of proteins in the AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK)/proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha)
      pathway. Following treatment with compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, the
      expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA and
      RT-qPCR analysis. The levels of oxidative stress-related markers were detected
      using corresponding kits following treatment with compound C. In addition, TUNEL 
      staining was performed to detect the apoptosis of AML12 cells, and western blot
      analysis was performed to investigate the expression levels of apoptosis-related 
      proteins. Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced by LPS in AML12 cells. LPS
      stimulation significantly downregulated the expression of proteins in the
      AMPK/PGC-1alpha pathway, which was reversed following treatment with XML. In
      addition, inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by
      LPS were alleviated by XML in AML12 cells. However, the addition of compound C
      and XML to LPS-induced AML12 cells resulted in the aggravation of cell injury.
      Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that XML suppressed
      mitochondrial dysfunction induced by LPS by activating AMPK/PGC-1alpha signaling.
      Thus, the results of the present study may contribute to further understanding of
      the underlying mechanism via which XML alleviates liver injury.

TI  - Efficient processing of complex XSD using Hive and Spark.
PG  - e652
LID - 10.7717/peerj-cs.652 [doi]
AB  - The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files are widely used by the industry due to
      their flexibility in representing numerous kinds of data. Multiple applications
      such as financial records, social networks, and mobile networks use complex XML
      schemas with nested types, contents, and/or extension bases on existing complex
      elements or large real-world files. A great number of these files are generated
      each day and this has influenced the development of Big Data tools for their
      parsing and reporting, such as Apache Hive and Apache Spark. For these reasons,
      multiple studies have proposed new techniques and evaluated the processing of XML
      files with Big Data systems. However, a more usual approach in such works
      involves the simplest XML schemas, even though, real data sets are composed of
      complex schemas. Therefore, to shed light on complex XML schema processing for
      real-life applications with Big Data tools, we present an approach that combines 
      three techniques. This comprises three main methods for parsing XML files:
      cataloging, deserialization, and positional explode. For cataloging, the elements
      of the XML schema are mapped into root, arrays, structures, values, and
      attributes. Based on these elements, the deserialization and positional explode
      are straightforwardly implemented. To demonstrate the validity of our proposal,
      we develop a case study by implementing a test environment to illustrate the
      methods using real data sets provided from performance management of two mobile
      network vendors. Our main results state the validity of the proposed method for
      different versions of Apache Hive and Apache Spark, obtain the query execution
      times for Apache Hive internal and external tables and Apache Spark data frames, 
      and compare the query performance in Apache Hive with that of Apache Spark.
      Another contribution made is a case study in which a novel solution is proposed
      for data analysis in the performance management systems of mobile networks.

TI  - Use of research electronic data capture (REDCap) in a COVID-19 randomized
      controlled trial: a practical example.
PG  - 175
LID - 10.1186/s12874-021-01362-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are considered the ideal design
      for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. However, conducting a successful
      RCT has technological and logistical challenges. Defects in randomization
      processes (e.g., allocation sequence concealment) and flawed masking could bias
      an RCT's findings. Moreover, investigators need to address other logistics common
      to all study designs, such as study invitations, eligibility screening,
      consenting procedure, and data confidentiality protocols. Research Electronic
      Data Capture (REDCap) is a secure, browser-based web application widely used by
      researchers for survey data collection. REDCap offers unique features that can be
      used to conduct rigorous RCTs. METHODS: In September and November 2020, we
      conducted a parallel group RCT among Indiana University Bloomington (IUB)
      undergraduate students to understand if receiving the results of a SARS-CoV-2
      antibody test changed the students' self-reported protective behavior against
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the current report, we discuss how we
      used REDCap to conduct the different components of this RCT. We further share our
      REDCap project XML file and instructional videos that investigators can use when 
      designing and conducting their RCTs. RESULTS: We reported on the different
      features that REDCap offers to complete various parts of a large RCT, including
      sending study invitations and recruitment, eligibility screening, consenting
      procedures, lab visit appointment and reminders, data collection and
      confidentiality, randomization, blinding of treatment arm assignment, returning

TI  - COVID term: a bilingual terminology for COVID-19.
PG  - 231
LID - 10.1186/s12911-021-01593-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a pneumonia caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown its
      destructiveness with more than one million confirmed cases and dozens of
      thousands of death, which is highly contagious and still spreading globally.
      World-wide studies have been conducted aiming to understand the COVID-19
      mechanism, transmission, clinical features, etc. A cross-language terminology of 
      COVID-19 is essential for improving knowledge sharing and scientific discovery
      dissemination. METHODS: We developed a bilingual terminology of COVID-19 named
      COVID Term with mapping Chinese and English terms. The terminology was
      constructed as follows: (1) Classification schema design; (2) Concept
      representation model building; (3) Term source selection and term extraction; (4)
      Hierarchical structure construction; (5) Quality control (6) Web service. We
      built open access for the terminology, providing search, browse, and download
      services. RESULTS: The proposed COVID Term include 10 categories: disease,
      anatomic site, clinical manifestation, demographic and socioeconomic
      characteristics, living organism, qualifiers, psychological assistance, medical
      equipment, instruments and materials, epidemic prevention and control, diagnosis 
      and treatment technique respectively. In total, COVID Terms covered 464 concepts 
      with 724 Chinese terms and 887 English terms. All terms are openly available
      online (COVID Term URL: http://covidterm.imicams.ac.cn ). CONCLUSIONS: COVID Term
      is a bilingual terminology focused on COVID-19, the epidemic pneumonia with a
      high risk of infection around the world. It will provide updated bilingual terms 
      of the disease to help health providers and medical professionals retrieve and
      exchange information and knowledge in multiple languages. COVID Term was released
      in machine-readable formats (e.g., XML and JSON), which would contribute to the
      information retrieval, machine translation and advanced intelligent techniques
      application.

TI  - Metadata Made Easy: Develop and Use Domain-Specific Metadata Schemes by following
      the dmdScheme approach.
PG  - 9174-9181
LID - 10.1002/ece3.7764 [doi]
AB  - Metadata plays an essential role in the long-term preservation, reuse, and
      interoperability of data. Nevertheless, creating useful metadata can be
      sufficiently difficult and weakly enough incentivized that many datasets may be
      accompanied by little or no metadata. One key challenge is, therefore, how to
      make metadata creation easier and more valuable. We present a solution that
      involves creating domain-specific metadata schemes that are as complex as
      necessary and as simple as possible. These goals are achieved by co-development
      between a metadata expert and the researchers (i.e., the data creators). The
      final product is a bespoke metadata scheme into which researchers can enter
      information (and validate it) via the simplest of interfaces: a web browser
      application and a spreadsheet.We provide the R package dmdScheme (dmdScheme: An R
      package for working with domain specific MetaData schemes (Version v0.9.22),
      2019) for creating a template domain-specific scheme. We describe how to create a
      domain-specific scheme from this template, including the iterative co-development
      process, and the simple methods for using the scheme, and simple methods for
      quality assessment, improvement, and validation.The process of developing a
      metadata scheme following the outlined approach was successful, resulting in a
      metadata scheme which is used for the data generated in our research group. The
      validation quickly identifies forgotten metadata, as well as inconsistent
      metadata, therefore improving the quality of the metadata. Multiple output
      formats are available, including XML.Making the provision of metadata easier
      while also ensuring high quality must be a priority for data curation
      initiatives. We show how both objectives are achieved by close collaboration
      between metadata experts and researchers to create domain-specific schemes. A
      near-future priority is to provide methods to interface domain-specific schemes
      with general metadata schemes, such as the Ecological Metadata Language, to
      increase interoperability.

TI  - Intricate scientometric analysis and citation trend of COVID-19-related
      publications in Indian Journal of Ophthalmology during COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 2202-2210
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_829_21 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To analyze the trend of COVID-19-related publications in the Indian
      Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO) and assess the specialty wise correlation,
      distribution, and citation trend during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A
      retrospective analysis of all COVID-19-related articles was performed from April 
      2020 to May 2021. The bibliographic records were obtained from the website of
      IJO, Editor IJO email, and PubMed. The data was then exported as XML into
      Microsoft access for scientometric analysis. The articles were segregated as
      Original, Review, Case Report/Series, Letter to the Editor/Commentary, Guest
      Editorial, PointCounterpoint, Consensus Criteria, Ophthalmic Images, Photo Essay,
      Surgical Techniques, and All India Ophthalmic Society Meeting Papers. The data
      was comprehensively analyzed for specialty-wise correlations, distribution,
      citation trend, and reasons for the same. Results: A total of 231
      COVID-19-related articles were published during the study period. The maximum
      articles were [82 (35.49%)] letters to the editor, followed by [51 (22.08%)]
      original articles, [30 (12.99%)] commentaries, and [20 (8.66%)] editorials. The
      least were perspectives, consensus, images, and photo assay with [1 (0.43%)]
      each. The maximum publications were in July [44 (19.05%)] and least in April [1
      (0.43%)]. Considering specialty, the maximum articles were related to general
      ophthalmology [124 (53.68%)] and least were in refractive surgery and community
      ophthalmology with [1 (0.43%)] each. The maximum citations were for original
      articles [352 (34.65%)], which was 2.3 times higher than review articles and
      letters to editor [150 (14.76%)]. General ophthalmology had 740 (72.83%)
      citations, which were nearly five times that of cornea [140 (13.78%)].
      Conclusion: The IJO showed a trough and crest pattern of COVID-19 publications
      month wise. Letter to editor and general ophthalmology COVID-19 articles had
      maximum publications with maximum citations for general ophthalmology owing to
      practice patterns and COVID-19 challenges.

TI  - MIIND : A Model-Agnostic Simulator of Neural Populations.
PG  - 614881
LID - 10.3389/fninf.2021.614881 [doi]
AB  - MIIND is a software platform for easily and efficiently simulating the behaviour 
      of interacting populations of point neurons governed by any 1D or 2D dynamical
      system. The simulator is entirely agnostic to the underlying neuron model of each
      population and provides an intuitive method for controlling the amount of noise
      which can significantly affect the overall behaviour. A network of populations
      can be set up quickly and easily using MIIND's XML-style simulation file format
      describing simulation parameters such as how populations interact, transmission
      delays, post-synaptic potentials, and what output to record. During simulation, a
      visual display of each population's state is provided for immediate feedback of
      the behaviour and population activity can be output to a file or passed to a
      Python script for further processing. The Python support also means that MIIND
      can be integrated into other software such as The Virtual Brain. MIIND's
      population density technique is a geometric and visual method for describing the 
      activity of each neuron population which encourages a deep consideration of the
      dynamics of the neuron model and provides insight into how the behaviour of each 
      population is affected by the behaviour of its neighbours in the network. For 1D 
      neuron models, MIIND performs far better than direct simulation solutions for
      large populations. For 2D models, performance comparison is more nuanced but the 
      population density approach still confers certain advantages over direct
      simulation. MIIND can be used to build neural systems that bridge the scales
      between an individual neuron model and a population network. This allows
      researchers to maintain a plausible path back from mesoscopic to microscopic
      scales while minimising the complexity of managing large numbers of
      interconnected neurons. In this paper, we introduce the MIIND system, its usage, 
      and provide implementation details where appropriate.

TI  - SPART: A versatile and standardized data exchange format for species partition
      information.
PG  - 430-438
LID - 10.1111/1755-0998.13470 [doi]
AB  - A wide range of data types can be used to delimit species and various
      computer-based tools dedicated to this task are now available. Although these
      formalized approaches have significantly contributed to increase the objectivity 
      of species delimitation (SD) under different assumptions, they are not routinely 
      used by alpha-taxonomists. One obvious shortcoming is the lack of
      interoperability among the various independently developed SD programs. Given the
      frequent incongruences between species partitions inferred by different SD
      approaches, researchers applying these methods often seek to compare these
      alternative species partitions to evaluate the robustness of the species
      boundaries. This procedure is excessively time consuming at present, and the lack
      of a standard format for species partitions is a major obstacle. Here, we propose
      a standardized format, SPART, to enable compatibility between different SD tools 
      exporting or importing partitions. This format reports the partitions and
      describes, for each of them, the assignment of individuals to the "inferred
      species". The syntax also allows support values to be optionally reported, as
      well as original trees and the full command lines used in the respective SD
      analyses. Two variants of this format are proposed, overall using the same
      terminology but presenting the data either optimized for human readability
      (matricial SPART) or in a format in which each partition forms a separate block
      (SPART.XML). ABGD, DELINEATE, GMYC, PTP and TR2 have already been adapted to
      output SPART files and a new version of LIMES has been developed to import,
      export, merge and split them.

TI  - Updating search strategies for literature reviews with OUR2D2: an open-source
      computer application.
PG  - 317-322
LID - 10.5195/jmla.2021.1105 [doi]
AB  - Background: While writing a scoping review, we needed to update our search
      strategy. We wanted to capture articles generated by our additional search terms 
      and articles published since our original search. Simultaneously, we strove to
      optimize project resources by not rescreening articles that had been captured in 
      our original results. Case presentation: In response, we created Open Update
      Re-run Deduplicate (OUR2D2), a computer application that allows the user to
      compare search results from a variety of library databases. OUR2D2 supports
      extensible markup language (XML) files from EndNote and comma-separated values
      (CSV) files using article titles for comparisons. We conducted unit tests to
      ensure appropriate functionality as well as accurate data extraction and
      analysis. We tested OUR2D2 by comparing original and updated search results from 
      PubMed, Embase, Clarivate Web of Science, CINAHL, Scopus, ProQuest Dissertation
      and Theses, and Lens and estimate that this application saved twenty-one hours of
      work during the screening process. Conclusions: OUR2D2 could be useful for
      individuals seeking to update literature review strategies across fields without 
      rescreening articles from previous searches. Because the OUR2D2 source code is
      freely available with a permissive license, we recommend this application for
      researchers conducting literature reviews who need to update their search results
      over time, want a powerful and flexible analysis framework, and may not have
      access to paid subscription tools.

TI  - Survey of X-ray induced Cherenkov excited fluorophores with potential for human
      use.
PG  - 833-840
LID - 10.1093/jrr/rrab055 [doi]
AB  - X-ray induced molecular luminescence (XML) is a phenomenon that can be utilized
      for clinical, deep-tissue functional imaging of tailored molecular probes. In
      this study, a survey of common or clinically approved fluorophores was carried
      out for their megavoltage X-ray induced excitation and emission characteristics. 
      We find that direct scintillation effects and Cherenkov generation are two
      possible ways to cause these molecules' excitation. To distinguish the
      contributions of each excitation mechanism, we exploited the dependency of
      Cherenkov radiation yield on X-ray energy. The probes were irradiated by constant
      dose of 6 MV and 18 MV X-ray radiation, and their relative emission intensities
      and spectra were quantified for each X-ray energy pair. From the ratios of XML,
      yield for 6 MV and 18 MV irradiation we found that the Cherenkov radiation
      dominated as an excitation mechanism, except for aluminum phthalocyanine, which
      exhibited substantial scintillation. The highest emission yields were detected
      from fluorescein, proflavin and aluminum phthalocyanine, in that order. XML yield
      was found to be affected by the emission quantum yield, overlap of the
      fluorescence excitation and Cherenkov emission spectra, scintillation yield.
      Considering all these factors and XML emission spectrum respective to tissue
      optical window, aluminum phthalocyanine offers the best XML yield for deep tissue
      use, while fluorescein and proflavine are most useful for subcutaneous or
      superficial use.

TI  - MAGICPL: A Generic Process Description Language for Distributed Pseudonymization 
      Scenarios.
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1055/s-0041-1731387 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pseudonymization is an important aspect of projects dealing with
      sensitive patient data. Most projects build their own specialized, hard-coded,
      solutions. However, these overlap in many aspects of their functionality. As any 
      re-implementation binds resources, we would like to propose a solution that
      facilitates and encourages the reuse of existing components. METHODS: We analyzed
      already-established data protection concepts to gain an insight into their common
      features and the ways in which their components were linked together. We found
      that we could represent these pseudonymization processes with a simple
      descriptive language, which we have called MAGICPL, plus a relatively small set
      of components. We designed MAGICPL as an XML-based language, to make it
      human-readable and accessible to nonprogrammers. Additionally, a prototype
      implementation of the components was written in Java. MAGICPL makes it possible
      to reference the components using their class names, making it easy to extend or 
      exchange the component set. Furthermore, there is a simple HTTP application
      programming interface (API) that runs the tasks and allows other systems to
      communicate with the pseudonymization process. RESULTS: MAGICPL has been used in 
      at least three projects, including the re-implementation of the pseudonymization 
      process of the German Cancer Consortium, clinical data flows in a large-scale
      translational research network (National Network Genomic Medicine), and for our
      own institute's pseudonymization service. CONCLUSIONS: Putting our solution into 
      productive use at both our own institute and at our partner sites facilitated a
      reduction in the time and effort required to build pseudonymization pipelines in 
      medical research.

TI  - Data element mapping to analyze fit for use of three XML standards for health
      workforce tracking.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/s12960-021-00615-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ensuring a sufficient supply and distribution of health care
      professionals is essential to meeting public health needs. Regulatory agencies
      protect their communities by ensuring that new health professionals have the
      required qualifications to practice safely and by tracking the volume and
      distribution of those professionals on an ongoing basis. The speed and accuracy
      of sharing these data could be greatly improved through the adoption of a data
      standard for information about health professionals. To date, however, no
      internationally accepted standard has emerged for this purpose. PURPOSE: This
      study examines three existing XML standards designed for the representation of
      individual worker data to determine if, and to what degree, each could be used
      for the tracking of health professionals. METHODS: The data elements of the
      Europass schema, the HR Open Standard Recruiting specification, and the
      MedBiquitous Healthcare Professional Profile standard were fully examined and
      matching elements were mapped to the 200+ elements identified from a prior
      content analysis as required by a sample of 20 international regulatory agencies.
      RESULTS: None of the schemas examined addressed more than half of the information
      elements required by regulators. All three schemas are found lacking in some key 
      areas of interest, especially vital information that could disqualify ineligible 
      applicant practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The three standards could all be improved
      by including new elements essential to regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies
      should be consulted in the development of new standards for representing
      potentially disqualifying information about candidates for professional practice.

      Effect on Eczema.
PG  - 8406127
LID - 10.1155/2021/8406127 [doi]
AB  - Eczema is a complex chronic inflammatory skin disease impacted by environmental
      factors, infections, immune disorders, and deficiencies in skin barrier function.
      Shi Zhen Tea (SZT), derived from traditional Chinese medicine Xiao-Feng-San, has 
      shown to be an effective integrative therapy for treating skin lesions, itching, 
      and sleeping loss, and it facilitates reduction of topical steroid and
      antihistamine use in pediatric and adult patients with severe eczema. Yet, its
      active compounds and therapeutic mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this
      study, we sought to investigate the active compounds and molecular mechanisms of 
      SZT in treating eczema using systems pharmacology and in silico docking analysis.
      SZT is composed of 4 medicinal herbs, Baizhu (Atractylodis macrocephalae
      rhizome), Jingjie (Schizonepetae herba), Kushen (Sophorae flavescentis radix),
      and Niubangzi (Arctii fructus). We first identified 51 active compounds from SZT 
      and their 81 potential molecular targets by high-throughput computational
      analysis, from which we identified 4 major pathways including Th17 cell
      differentiation, metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, and the PI3K-Akt
      signaling pathway. Through network analysis of the compound-target pathway, we
      identified hub molecular targets within these pathways including carbonic
      anhydrase II (CA2), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR
      gamma), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), and vitamin D receptor (VDR). We
      further identified top 5 compounds including cynarine, stigmasterin, kushenol,
      beta-sitosterol, and (24S)-24-propylcholesta-5-ene-3beta-ol as putative key
      active compounds on the basis of their molecular docking scores with identified
      hub target proteins. Our study provides an insight into the therapeutic mechanism
      underlying multiscale benefits of SZT for eczema and paves the way for developing
      new and potentially more effective eczema therapies.

TI  - openEHR Mapper - A Tool to Fuse Clinical and Genomic Data Using the openEHR
      Standard.
PG  - 86-93
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210055 [doi]
AB  - Precision medicine is an emerging and important field for health care. Molecular 
      tumor boards use a combination of clinical and molecular data, such as somatic
      tumor mutations to decide on personalized therapies for patients who have run out
      of standard treatment options. Personalized treatment decisions require clinical 
      data from the hospital information system and mutation data to be accessible in a
      structured way. Here we introduce an open data platform to meet these
      requirements. We use the openEHR standard to create an expert-curated data model 
      that is stored in a vendor-neutral format. Clinical and molecular patient data is
      integrated into cBioPortal, a warehousing solution for cancer genomic studies
      that is extended for use in clinical routine for molecular tumor boards. For data
      integration, we developed openEHR Mapper, a tool that allows to (i) process input
      data, (ii) communicate with the openEHR repository, and (iii) export the data to 
      cBioPortal. We benchmarked the mapper performance using XML and JSON as
      serialization format and added caching capabilities as well as multi-threading to
      the openEHR Mapper.

TI  - Using QR Code for Uniform Representation of Content in Cross-Border Exchange of
      ePrescriptions in the EU.
PG  - 684-688
LID - 10.3233/SHTI210259 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes an approach and demonstrates its application for cross-border
      exchange of ePrescriptions in the European Union. A business process model of the
      main use case for exchange of prescription content in the eHealth Digital Service
      Infrastructure is created and analyzed. The novelty in this approach is the
      proposed encoding of the basic dataset in a Quick Response (QR) code in terms of 
      an XML scheme that is independent of clinical models or proprietary database
      structures. It allows to inverse the dataflow control in the chain of message
      exchanges between Dispenser and National Contact Points. The proposed inversion
      of control positions the citizen with the QR code of the prescription in the
      center of that chain of message exchanges between the main actors of the business
      process. The independent format of content representation in the QR code allows
      the actors in the message exchange to auto-populate data in their registers when 
      the medicine is dispensed. Initial results are reported and reveal the advantages
      of embedding prescription details in QR code employing a common independent XML
      scheme.

TI  - Stepwise metabolic engineering of Candida tropicalis for efficient xylitol
      production from xylose mother liquor.
PG  - 105
LID - 10.1186/s12934-021-01596-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Commercial xylose purification produces xylose mother liquor (XML) as
      a major byproduct, which has become an inexpensive and abundant carbon source. A 
      portion of this XML has been used to produce low-value-added products such as
      caramel but the remainder often ends up as an organic pollutant. This has become 
      an issue of industrial concern. In this study, a uracil-deficient Candida
      tropicalis strain was engineered to efficiently convert XML to the commercially
      useful product xylitol. RESULTS: The xylitol dehydrogenase gene was deleted to
      block the conversion of xylitol to xylulose. Then, an NADPH regeneration system
      was added through heterologous expression of the Yarrowia lipolytica genes
      encoding 6-phosphate-gluconic acid dehydrogenase and 6-phosphate-glucose
      dehydrogenase. After process optimization, the engineered strain, C. tropicalis
      XZX-B4ZG, produced 97.10 g L(- 1) xylitol in 120 h from 300 g L(- 1) XML in a 5-L
      fermenter. The xylitol production rate was 0.82 g L(- 1 )h(- 1) and the
      conversion rate was 92.40 %. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study performed a
      combination of metabolic engineering and process optimizing in C. tropicalis to
      enhance xylitol production from XML. The use of C. tropicalis XZX-B4ZG,
      therefore, provided a convenient method to transform the industrial by-product
      XML into the useful material xylitol.

TI  - Comparison of Treatments for Cocaine Use Disorder Among Adults: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - e218049
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.8049 [doi]
AB  - Importance: In the US and the United Kingdom, cocaine use is the second leading
      cause of illicit drug overdose death. Psychosocial treatments for cocaine use
      disorder are limited, and no pharmacotherapy is approved for use in the US or
      Europe. Objective: To compare treatments for active cocaine use among adults.
      Data Sources: PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were
      searched for clinical trials published between December 31, 1995, and December
      31, 2017. Study Selection: This meta-analysis was registered on Covidence.org
      (study 8731) on December 31, 2015. Clinical trials were included if they (1) had 
      the term cocaine in the article title; (2) were published between December 31,
      1995, and December 31, 2017; (3) were written in English; (4) enrolled
      outpatients 18 years or older with active cocaine use at baseline; and (5)
      reported treatment group size, treatment duration, retention rates, and
      urinalysis results for the presence of cocaine metabolites. A study was excluded 
      if (1) more than 25% of participants were not active cocaine users or more than
      80% of participants had negative test results for the presence of cocaine
      metabolites at baseline and (2) it reported only pooled urinalysis results
      indicating the presence of multiple substances and did not report the specific
      proportion of positive test results for cocaine metabolites. Multiple reviewers
      reached criteria consensus. Of 831 records screened, 157 studies (18.9%) met
      selection criteria and were included in the analysis. Data Extraction and
      Synthesis: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Search results were imported from
      PubMed XML into Covidence.org then Microsoft Excel. Data extraction was completed
      in 2 iterations to ensure fidelity. Analyses included a multilevel random-effects
      model, a multilevel mixed-effects meta-regression model, and sensitivity
      analyses. Treatments were clustered into 11 categories (psychotherapy,
      contingency management programs, placebo, opioids, psychostimulants,
      anticonvulsants, dopamine agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics,
      miscellaneous medications, and other therapies). Missing data were imputed using 
      multiple imputation by chained equations. The significance threshold for all
      analyses was P = .05. Data were analyzed using the metafor and mice packages in R
      software, version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Data were
      analyzed from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: 
      The primary outcome was the intention-to-treat logarithm of the odds ratio (OR)
      of having a negative urinalysis result for the presence of cocaine metabolites at
      the end of each treatment period compared with baseline. The hypothesis, which
      was formulated after data collection, was that no treatment category would have a
      significant association with objective reductions in cocaine use. Results: A
      total of 157 studies comprising 402 treatment groups and 15842 participants were 
      included. Excluding other therapies, the largest treatment groups across all
      studies were psychotherapy (mean [SD] number of participants, 40.04 [36.88]) and 
      contingency management programs (mean [SD] number of participants, 37.51
      [25.51]). Only contingency management programs were significantly associated with
      an increased likelihood of having a negative test result for the presence of
      cocaine (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.62-2.80), and this association remained significant 
      in all sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis,
      contingency management programs were associated with reductions in cocaine use
      among adults. Research efforts and policies that align with this treatment
      modality may benefit those who actively use cocaine and attenuate societal
      burdens.

AB  - Mobile phone data collection tools are increasingly becoming very usable
      collecting, collating and analysing data in the health sector. In this paper, we 
      documented the experiences with mobile phone data collection, collation and
      analysis in 5 countries of the East and Southern African, using Open Data Kit
      (ODK), where questionnaires were designed and coded on an XML form, uploaded and 
      data collected using Android-Based mobile phones, with a web-based system to
      monitor data in real-time during EPI comprehensive review. The ODK interface
      supports in real-time monitoring of the flow of data, detection of missing or
      incomplete data, coordinate location of all locations visited, embedded charts
      for basic analysis. It also minimized data quality errors at entry level with the
      use of validation codes and constraint developed into the checklist. These
      benefits, combined with the improvement that mobile phones offer over paper-based
      in terms of timeliness, data loss, collation, and real-time data collection,
      analysis and uploading difficulties, make mobile phone data collection a feasible
      method of data collection that needs to be further explored in the conduct of all
      surveys in the organization.

AB  - Background: Results of scientific experiments and research work, either conducted
      by individuals or organizations, are published and shared with scientific
      community in different types of scientific publications such as books, chapters, 
      journals, articles, reference works and reference works entries. One aspect of
      these documents is their contents and the other is metadata. Metadata of
      scientific documents could be used to increase mutual cooperation, find people
      with common interest and research work, and to find scientific documents in the
      matching domains. The major issue in getting these benefits from metadata of
      scientific publications is availability of these data in unstructured (or
      semi-structured) format so that it can not be used to ask smart queries that can 
      help in computing and performing different types of analysis on scientific
      publications data. Also, acquisition and smart processing of publications data is
      a complicated as well as time and resource consuming task. Methods: To address
      this problem we have developed a generic framework named as Linked Open
      Publications Data Framework (LOPDF). The LOPDF framework can be used to crawl,
      process, extract and produce machine understandable data (i.e., LOD) about
      scientific publications from different publisher specific sources such as
      portals, XML export and websites. In this paper we present the architecture,
      process and algorithm that we developed to process textual publications data and 
      to produce semantically enriched data as RDF datasets (i.e., open data). Results:
      The resulting datasets can be used to make smart queries by making use of SPARQL 
      protocol. We also present the quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of our
      resulting datasets which ultimately can be used to compute the research behavior 
      of organizations in rapidly growing knowledge society. Finally, we present the
      potential usage of producing and processing such open data of scientific
      publications and how results of performing smart queries on resulting open
      datasets can be used to compute the impact and perform different types of
      analysis on scientific publications data.

AB  - Structured representation of clinical genetic results is necessary for advancing 
      precision medicine. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE)
      Network's Phase III program initially used a commercially developed XML message
      format for standardized and structured representation of genetic results for
      electronic health record (EHR) integration. In a desire to move towards a
      standard representation, the network created a new standardized format based upon
      Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7(R) FHIR(R)),
      to represent clinical genomics results. These new standards improve the utility
      of HL7(R) FHIR(R) as an international healthcare interoperability standard for
      management of genetic data from patients. This work advances the establishment of
      standards that are being designed for broad adoption in the current health
      information technology landscape.

TI  - Xinmailong Attenuates Doxorubicin-Induced Lysosomal Dysfunction and Oxidative
      Stress in H9c2 Cells via HO-1.
PG  - 5896931
LID - 10.1155/2021/5896931 [doi]
AB  - The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxicity, which is 
      closely associated with oxidative stress. Xinmailong (XML) is a bioactive peptide
      extracted from American cockroaches, which has been mainly applied to treat
      chronic heart failure in China. Our previous study showed that XML attenuates
      DOX-induced oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of XML in DOX-induced
      cardiotoxicity remains unclear. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme that is
      ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, has been found to take antioxidant
      effects in many cardiovascular diseases, and its expression is protectively
      upregulated under DOX treatment. Lysosome and autophagy are closely involved in
      oxidative stress as well. It is still unknown whether XML could attenuate
      doxorubicin-induced lysosomal dysfunction and oxidative stress in H9c2 cells via 
      HO-1. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating the involvement of
      HO-1-mediated lysosomal function and autophagy flux in DOX-induced oxidative
      stress and cardiotoxicity in H9c2 cells. Our results showed that XML treatment
      markedly increased cell proliferation and SOD activity, improved lysosomal
      function, and ameliorated autophagy flux block in DOX-treated H9c2 cells.
      Furthermore, XML significantly increased HO-1 expression following DOX treatment.
      Importantly, HO-1-specific inhibitor (Znpp) or HO-1 siRNA could significantly
      attenuate the protective effects of XML against DOX-induced cell injury,
      oxidative stress, lysosomal dysfunction, and autophagy flux block. These results 
      suggest that XML protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through
      HO-1-mediated recovery of lysosomal function and autophagy flux and decreases
      oxidative stress, providing a novel mechanism responsible for the protection of
      XML against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Major issues in imaging data management of tumor response assessment
      in clinical trials include high human errors in data input and unstandardized
      data structures, warranting a new breakthrough IT solution. Thus, we aim to
      develop a Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)-compliant
      clinical trial imaging management system (CTIMS) with automatic verification and 
      transformation modules for implementing the CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model
      (SDTM) in the tumor response assessment dataset of clinical trials. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: In accordance with various CDISC standards guides and Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, the overall system
      architecture of CDISC-compliant CTIMS was designed. Modules for
      standard-compliant electronic case report form (eCRF) to verify data conformance 
      and transform into SDTM data format were developed by experts in diverse fields
      such as medical informatics, medical, and clinical trial. External validation of 
      the CDISC-compliant CTIMS was performed by comparing it with our previous CTIMS
      based on real-world data and CDISC validation rules by Pinnacle 21 Community
      Software. RESULTS: The architecture of CDISC-compliant CTIMS included the
      standard-compliant eCRF module of RECIST, the automatic verification module of
      the input data, and the SDTM transformation module from the eCRF input data to
      the SDTM datasets based on CDISC Define-XML. This new system was incorporated
      into our previous CTIMS. External validation demonstrated that all 176 human
      input errors occurred in the previous CTIMS filtered by a new system yielding
      zero error and CDISC-compliant dataset. The verified eCRF input data were
      automatically transformed into the SDTM dataset, which satisfied the CDISC
      validation rules by Pinnacle 21 Community Software. CONCLUSIONS: To assure data
      consistency and high quality of the tumor response assessment data, our new CTIMS
      can minimize human input error by using standard-compliant eCRF with an automatic
      verification module and automatically transform the datasets into CDISC SDTM
      format.

AB  - Resource Description Framework (RDF) is one of the three standardized data
      formats in the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
      specification and is being used by healthcare and research organizations to join 
      FHIR and non-FHIR data. However, RDF previously had not been integrated into
      popular FHIR tooling packages, hindering the adoption of FHIR RDF in the semantic
      web and other communities. The objective of the study is to develop and evaluate 
      a Java based FHIR RDF data transformation toolkit to facilitate the use and
      validation of FHIR RDF data. We extended the popular HAPI FHIR tooling to add RDF
      support, thus enabling FHIR data in XML or JSON to be transformed to or from RDF.
      We also developed an RDF Shape Expression (ShEx)-based validation framework to
      verify conformance of FHIR RDF data to the ShEx schemas provided in the FHIR
      specification for FHIR versions R4 and R5. The effectiveness of ShEx validation
      was demonstrated by testing it against 2693 FHIR R4 examples and 2197 FHIR R5
      examples that are included in the FHIR specification. A total of 5 types of
      errors including missing properties, unknown element, missing resource Type,
      invalid attribute value, and unknown resource name in the R5 examples were
      revealed, demonstrating the value of the ShEx in the quality assurance of the
      evolving R5 development. This FHIR RDF data transformation and validation
      framework, based on HAPI and ShEx, is robust and ready for community use in
      adopting FHIR RDF, improving FHIR data quality, and evolving the FHIR
      specification.

LID - 10.7717/peerj.11071 [doi]
AB  - PubMed is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community. Although PubMed is
      freely available, the existing API is not designed for large-scale analyses and
      the XML structure of the underlying data is inconvenient for complex queries. We 
      developed an R package called pmparser to convert the data in PubMed to a
      relational database. Our implementation of the database, called PMDB, currently
      contains data on over 31 million PubMed Identifiers (PMIDs) and is updated
      regularly. Together, pmparser and PMDB can enable large-scale, reproducible, and 
      transparent analyses of the biomedical literature. pmparser is licensed under
      GPL-2 and available at https://pmparser.hugheylab.org. PMDB is available in both 
      PostgreSQL (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.4008109) and Google BigQuery
      (https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=pmdb-bq&d=pmdb).

TI  - Structured Data Capture for Oncology.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1200/CCI.20.00103 [doi]
AB  - Lack of interoperability is one of the greatest challenges facing healthcare
      informatics. Recent interoperability efforts have focused primarily on data
      transmission and generally ignore data capture standardization. Structured Data
      Capture (SDC) is an open-source technical framework that enables the capture and 
      exchange of standardized and structured data in interoperable data entry forms
      (DEFs) at the point of care. Some of SDC's primary use cases concern complex
      oncology data such as anatomic pathology, biomarkers, and clinical oncology data 
      collection and reporting. Its interoperability goals are the preservation of
      semantic, contextual, and structural integrity of the captured data throughout
      the data's lifespan. SDC documents are written in eXtensible Markup Language
      (XML) and are therefore computer readable, yet technology agnostic-SDC can be
      implemented by any EHR vendor or registry. Any SDC-capable system can render an
      SDC XML file into a DEF, receive and parse an SDC transmission, and regenerate
      the original SDC form as a DEF or synoptic report with the response data intact. 
      SDC is therefore able to facilitate interoperable data capture and exchange for
      patient care, clinical trials, cancer surveillance and public health needs,
      clinical research, and computable care guidelines. The usability of SDC-captured 
      oncology data is enhanced when the SDC data elements are mapped to standard
      terminologies. For example, an SDC map to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine
      Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) enables aggregation of SDC data with other related
      data sets and permits advanced queries and groupings on the basis of SNOMED CT
      concept attributes and description logic. SDC supports terminology maps using
      separate map files or as terminology codes embedded in an SDC document.

TI  - Data-Driven Discovery of Molecular Targets for Antibody-Drug Conjugates in Cancer
      Treatment.
PG  - 2670573
LID - 10.1155/2021/2670573 [doi]
AB  - Antibody-drug conjugate therapy has attracted considerable attention in recent
      years. Since the selection of appropriate targets is a critical aspect of
      antibody-drug conjugate research and development, a big data research for
      discovery of candidate targets per tumor type is outstanding and of high
      interest. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify and prioritize
      candidate antibody-drug conjugate targets with translational potential across
      common types of cancer by mining the Human Protein Atlas, as a unique big data
      resource. To perform a multifaceted screening process, XML and TSV files
      including immunohistochemistry expression data for 45 normal tissues and 20 tumor
      types were downloaded from the Human Protein Atlas website. For genes without
      high protein expression across critical normal tissues, a quasi H-score (range,
      0-300) was computed per tumor type. All genes with a quasi H - score >/= 150 were
      extracted. Of these, genes with cell surface localization were selected and
      included in a multilevel validation process. Among 19670 genes that encode
      proteins, 5520 membrane protein-coding genes were included in this study. During 
      a multistep data mining procedure, 332 potential targets were identified based on
      the level of the protein expression across critical normal tissues and 20 tumor
      types. After validation, 23 cell surface proteins were identified and prioritized
      as candidate antibody-drug conjugate targets of which two have interestingly been
      approved by the FDA for use in solid tumors, one has been approved for lymphoma, 
      and four have currently been entered in clinical trials. In conclusion, we
      identified and prioritized several candidate targets with translational
      potential, which may yield new clinically effective and safe antibody-drug
      conjugates. This large-scale antibody-based proteomic study allows us to go
      beyond the RNA-seq studies, facilitates bench-to-clinic research of targeted
      anticancer therapeutics, and offers valuable insights into the development of new
      antibody-drug conjugates.

      Standards-Compliant mzML and Optimized for Speed and Storage Requirements.
PG  - 172-183
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00192 [doi]
AB  - With ever-increasing amounts of data produced by mass spectrometry (MS)
      proteomics and metabolomics, and the sheer volume of samples now analyzed, the
      need for a common open format possessing both file size efficiency and faster
      read/write speeds has become paramount to drive the next generation of data
      analysis pipelines. The Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) has established a
      clear and precise extensible markup language (XML) representation for data
      interchange, mzML, receiving substantial uptake; nevertheless, storage and file
      access efficiency has not been the main focus. We propose an HDF5 file format
      "mzMLb" that is optimized for both read/write speed and storage of the raw mass
      spectrometry data. We provide an extensive validation of the write speed, random 
      read speed, and storage size, demonstrating a flexible format that with or
      without compression is faster than all existing approaches in virtually all
      cases, while with compression is comparable in size to proprietary vendor file
      formats. Since our approach uniquely preserves the XML encoding of the metadata, 
      the format implicitly supports future versions of mzML and is straightforward to 
      implement: mzMLb's design adheres to both HDF5 and NetCDF4 standard
      implementations, which allows it to be easily utilized by third parties due to
      their widespread programming language support. A reference implementation within 
      the established ProteoWizard toolkit is provided.

TI  - Markov-Modulated Continuous-Time Markov Chains to Identify Site- and
      Branch-Specific Evolutionary Variation in BEAST.
PG  - 181-189
LID - 10.1093/sysbio/syaa037 [doi]
AB  - Markov models of character substitution on phylogenies form the foundation of
      phylogenetic inference frameworks. Early models made the simplifying assumption
      that the substitution process is homogeneous over time and across sites in the
      molecular sequence alignment. While standard practice adopts extensions that
      accommodate heterogeneity of substitution rates across sites, heterogeneity in
      the process over time in a site-specific manner remains frequently overlooked.
      This is problematic, as evolutionary processes that act at the molecular level
      are highly variable, subjecting different sites to different selective
      constraints over time, impacting their substitution behavior. We propose
      incorporating time variability through Markov-modulated models (MMMs), which
      extend covarion-like models and allow the substitution process (including
      relative character exchange rates as well as the overall substitution rate) at
      individual sites to vary across lineages. We implement a general MMM framework in
      BEAST, a popular Bayesian phylogenetic inference software package, allowing
      researchers to compose a wide range of MMMs through flexible XML specification.
      Using examples from bacterial, viral, and plastid genome evolution, we show that 
      MMMs impact phylogenetic tree estimation and can substantially improve model fit 
      compared to standard substitution models. Through simulations, we show that
      marginal likelihood estimation accurately identifies the generative model and
      does not systematically prefer the more parameter-rich MMMs. To mitigate the
      increased computational demands associated with MMMs, our implementation exploits
      recent developments in BEAGLE, a high-performance computational library for
      phylogenetic inference. [Bayesian inference; BEAGLE; BEAST; covarion,
      heterotachy; Markov-modulated models; phylogenetics.].

TI  - A Bibliometric Analysis of the Landscape of Parathyroid Carcinoma Research Based 
      on the PubMed (2000-2021).
PG  - 824201
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.824201 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the landscape of
      parathyroid carcinoma research during the last 22 years using machine learning
      and text analysis. Method: In November 2021, we obtained from PubMed all works
      indexed under the mesh subject line "parathyroid carcinoma". The entire set of
      search results was retrieved in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract,
      keywords, mesh words, and year of publication were extracted for bibliometric
      evaluation from the original XML files. To increase the specificity of the
      investigation, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was
      applied. Results: The paper analyzed 3578 papers. The volume of literature
      related to parathyroid cancer has been relatively flat over the past 22 years. In
      the field of parathyroid cancer research, the most important topic of clinical
      interest is the differential diagnosis. Ultrasound and MIBI are the most commonly
      used imaging methods for localization. In terms of basic research, the mechanisms
      of gene mutation and local tumor recurrence are the focus of interest.
      Conclusion: There are huge unmet research needs for parathyroid carcinoma.
      Improving the diagnosis rates of parathyroid cancer by clinicians and
      establishing new and reliable molecular pathological markers and new image
      localization techniques will continue to be the focus of future research.

TI  - Usage and Usability of a National e-Library for Chemotherapy Regimens: Mixed
      Methods Study.
PG  - e33651
LID - 10.2196/33651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate information about chemotherapy drugs and regimens is needed 
      to reduce chemotherapy errors. A national e-library, as a common knowledge source
      with standardized chemotherapy nomenclature and content, was developed. Since the
      information in the library is both complex and extensive, it is central that the 
      users can use the resource as intended. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the usage and usability of an extensive e-library for chemotherapy
      regimens developed to reduce medication errors, support the health care staff in 
      their work, and increase patient safety. METHODS: To obtain a comprehensive
      evaluation, a mixed methods study was performed for a broad view of the usage,
      including a compilation of subjective views of the users (web survey, spontaneous
      user feedback, and qualitative interviews), analysis of statistics from the
      website, and an expert evaluation of the usability of the webpage. RESULTS:
      Statistics from the website show an average of just over 2500 visits and 870
      unique visitors per month. Most visits took place Mondays to Fridays, but there
      were 5-10 visits per day on weekends. The web survey, with 292 answers, shows
      that the visitors were mainly physicians and nurses. Almost 80% (224/292) of
      respondents searched for regimens and 90% (264/292) found what they were looking 
      for and were satisfied with their visit. The expert evaluation shows that the
      e-library follows many existing design principles, thus providing some useful
      improvement suggestions. A total of 86 emails were received in 2020 with user
      feedback, most of which were from nurses. The main part (78%, 67/86) contained a 
      question, and the rest had discovered errors mainly in some regimen. The
      interviews reveal that most hospitals use a computerized physician order entry
      system, and they use the e-library in various ways, import XML files, transfer
      information, or use it as a reference. One hospital without a system uses the
      administration schedules from the library. CONCLUSIONS: The user evaluation
      indicates that the e-library is used in the intended manner and that the users
      can interact without problems. Users have different needs depending on their
      profession and their workplace, and these can be supported. The combination of
      methods applied ensures that the design and content comply with the users' needs 
      and serves as feedback for continuous design and learning. With a broad national 
      usage, the e-library can become a source for organizational and national learning
      and a source for continuous improvement of cancer care in Sweden.

      Extraction.
PG  - 89-94
LID - 10.4258/hir.2022.28.1.89 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to develop a generalizable annotation tool
      for bilingual complex clinical text annotation, which led to the design and
      development of a clinical text annotation tool, ANNO. Methods: We designed ANNO
      to enable human annotators to support the annotation of information in clinical
      documents efficiently and accurately. First, annotations for different classes
      (word or phrase types) can be tagged according to the type of word using the
      dictionary function. In addition, it is possible to evaluate and reconcile
      differences by comparing annotation results between human annotators. Moreover,
      if the regular expression set for each class is updated during annotation, it is 
      automatically reflected in the new document. The regular expression set created
      by human annotators is designed such that a word tagged once is automatically
      labeled in new documents. RESULTS: Because ANNO is a Docker-based web
      application, users can use it freely without being subjected to dependency
      issues. Human annotators can share their annotation markups as regular expression
      sets with a dictionary structure, and they can cross-check their annotated
      corpora with each other. The dictionary-based regular expression sharing
      function, cross-check function for each annotator, and standardized input
      (Microsoft Excel) and output (extensible markup language [XML]) formats are the
      main features of ANNO. Conclusions: With the growing need for massively annotated
      clinical data to support the development of machine learning models, we expect
      ANNO to be helpful to many researchers.

      PKC and PLA2 Proteins.
PG  - 827691
LID - 10.3389/fcell.2022.827691 [doi]
AB  - Background: Xinmailong (XML) injection is a CFDA-approved traditional Chinese
      medicine with clinical value for heart failure treatment. The present
      investigation was aimed to evaluate the potential protective roles of this
      injection on myocardial ischemia and the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods:
      In our study, we selected two models of myocardial ischemia rats. Rats were
      randomly divided into six groups, with saline or XML administrated 4 days before 
      ischemia model establishment. ECG of different time intervals and biochemical
      parameters of end point were measured. The potential mechanisms of the protective
      role of XML were explored using system pharmacology and molecular biology
      approaches. Results: Myocardial ischemia rats demonstrated abnormal ECG and serum
      levels of cTnT. Pretreatment with XML significantly attenuated these damages,
      especially the medium doses. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that the 90 putative
      target genes were associated with pathways of fatty acid absorption/metabolism,
      inflammation, RAAS, and vascular smooth muscle. Further network pharmacology
      method identified five main chemical ingredients and potential targets of XML
      injection for myocardial ischemia. Mechanically, the beneficial effect of XML
      injection was mediated by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition and
      inflammation attenuation via regulating the expression levels of targets of PKC
      and PLA2. Conclusion: These findings indicate that XML exerts protective effects 
      against myocardial injury, with attenuated ROS production, apoptosis, and
      inflammation. Therefore, we speculate that XML may be an alternative
      supplementary therapeutic agent for myocardial ischemia prevention.

TI  - Next-generation sequencing markup language (NGSML): a medium for the
      representation and exchange of NGS data.
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2022.3144170 [doi]
AB  - With the increasing demand for low-cost high-throughput sequencing of large
      genomes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has developed rapidly. NGS
      can not only be used in basic scientific research but also in clinical
      diagnostics and healthcare. Numerous software systems and tools have been
      developed to analyze NGS data, and various data formats have been produced to
      accommodate different sequencing equipment providers or analytical software.
      However, the data interoperability between these tools brings great challenges to
      researchers. A generic format that could be shared by most of the software and
      tools in the NGS field would make data interoperability and sharing easier. In
      this paper, we defined a general XML-based NGS markup language (NGSML) format for
      the representation and exchange of NGS data. We also developed a user-friendly
      GUI tool, NGSMLEditor, for presenting, creating, editing, and converting NGSML
      files. By using NGSML, various types of NGS data can be saved in one unified

TI  - A Multilingual Browser Platform for Medical Subject Headings.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI210939 [doi]
AB  - The National Library of Medicine (NLM) controls and publishes the thesaurus
      Medical Subject Headings which is used for indexing PubMed. Besides an XML
      export, the NLM offers a web based MeSH browser. The platform contains English
      terms. The German Institute for Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI)
      partially translated and published these terms. Recently, the German National
      Library of Medicine (ZB-MED) overtook the translation of MeSH. However, there is 
      no dedicated platform which focuses on MeSH and covers multiple languages. Here, 
      we address this gap, by offering a modern multilingual searchable MeSH browser. A
      modular platform using open source technology is presented. The frontend enables 
      the user to search and browse terms and switch between different languages. The
      current version of the presented MeSH browser contains English and German MeSH
      terms and can be accessed at https://mesh-browser.de.

TI  - A B2N monolayer: a direct band gap semiconductor with high and highly anisotropic
      carrier mobility.
PG  - 930-938
LID - 10.1039/d1nr07054a [doi]
AB  - Two-dimensional materials with a planar lattice, suitable direct band gap, and
      high and highly anisotropic carrier mobility are desirable for the development of
      advanced field-effect transistors. Here we predict three thermodynamically stable
      B-rich 2D B-N compounds with the stoichiometries of B2N, B3N, and B4N using a
      combination of crystal structure searches and first-principles calculations.
      Among them, B2N has an ultraflat surface and consists of eight-membered B6N2 and 
      pentagonal B3N2 rings. The eight-membered B6N2 rings are linked to each other
      through both edge-sharing (in the y direction) and bridging B3N2 pentagons (in
      the x direction). B2N is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.96 eV, and
      the nature of the direct band gap is well preserved in bilayer B2N. The hole
      mobility of B2N is as high as 0.6 x 10(3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) along the y
      direction, 7.5 times that in the x direction. These combined novel properties
      render the B2N monolayer as a natural example in the field of two-dimensional
      functional materials with broad application potential for use in field-effect
      transistors.

TI  - Open-source feature detection for non-target LC-MS analytics.
PG  - e9206
LID - 10.1002/rcm.9206 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Non-target screening techniques using high-resolution mass
      spectrometers become more and more important for environmental sciences. Highly
      reliable and sophisticated software solutions are required to deal with the large
      amount of data obtained from such analyses. METHODS: Processing of
      high-resolution LC-HRMS data was performed upon conversion into an open,
      XML-based data format followed by an automated assignment of chromatographic
      peaks using the open-source programming language R. Raw data from three different
      LC-HRMS systems were processed as a proof of principle. RESULTS: We present a
      simple and straightforward algorithm to extract chromatographic peaks from
      previously m/z-centroided data based on the open-source programming language R
      and C++. The working principle and processing parameters are explained in detail.
      A ready-to-use script is provided in the supporting information. CONCLUSIONS: The
      developed algorithm enables a comprehensible automated peak picking of non-target
      LC-MS data. Application to three completely different HRMS raw data files showed 
      reasonable False Positives and False Negatives detection and moderate calculation
      times.
