PATIENT/METHODS: 1) Analysis of the waiting list mortality estimated on 228 inclusions for transplant since January 2004 to December 2008.2) Impact of the variant techniques (living-related donor and split) on the waiting  list mortality in our patients. 3) Analysis of the outcome of 33 split livers which allowed to perform 66 transplants (1994-2008). RESULTS: Estimated as number of patients by 1,000 candidates by year of exposure, the waiting list mortality was 110 in children older than 5 year old, 180 in children from 2 to 5 year-old,  90 in children between 1 and 2 year-old and 510 in younger than 1 year (p<0.05 for the last group). 36/66 split grafts were implanted by our group. Five grafts  were lost, 3 due to retransplantation and 2 due to death. Overall patient/graft survival alter 10 years of follow-up was 94.5% and 85.1%, respectively. The rest  of the grafts (n=30), were used in other hospitals, and 4 were lost in the early  postoperative period. Since the beginning of the study, 85.4% of children between 1 and 2 years, received a living-donor or a split graft, as only 59.9% in the younger than 1 year-old group. CONCLUSION: Our results absolutely justify the ethics of split liver transplantation for an adult and a child. Despite other factors, the benefits of the variant techniques in the 1-2 year-old group are obvious. Up to 60% optimization with these techniques in children younger than 1  year would not be yet enough in order to decrease the mortality waiting list down to that of the rest of the groups.;;Andres AM, Lopez Santamaria M, Burgos L, Hernandez F, Encinas JL, Barrena S, Miguel M, Leal N, Martinez L, Gamez M, Murcia J, Frauca E, Jara P, Tovar JA;;spa;['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hepatectomy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods'];;;;
2;21443156;Article;2010;Medicinski pregled;;Cadaveric organ transplantation and religion.;;Multiple organ procurement is a surgical procedure by which organs of a brain dead donor are taken for transplantation. Cadaveric organ donors must be those who have suffered a sudden structural and irreversible damage of the brain or brainstem. Social and scientific aspects of organ transplantation have been widely discussed so far, whereas the religious factor, which should be also respected, has rarely been analyzed. Considering the fact that Serbia is a multicultural and multi-confessional society, opinions of all confessions practised in the Republic of Serbia should be taken into account. The Orthodox Church permits transplantation from one man to another and transplantation is strongly recommended from the standpoint of Christian morality. These attitudes are accepted and respected by the Roman Catholic Church, Reformers, Judaism and Islam as well. For the future development of organ transplantation it is necessary to have a sufficient number of organ donors. Valid and complete laws must strictly define brain death, organ donation and waiting lists. The public should be fully informed about this issue in order to build mutual confidence between the population and medical staff.;;Vukovic M, Moljevic N, Katanic N, Krivokuca D, Vukovic V, Milosevic Z;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Humans', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Serbia', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;

4;21183963;Article;2010;Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia;;[Assessment and selection of kidney living donors].;;"Donor protection should always be taken account during the selection and assessment of a living donor. On these terms, the evaluation of a potential donor must include these issues: 1) The donor act is altruistic, consciousness and out  of coercion; 2) Life expectancy and quality of life of the recipient will improve after the living donor kidney transplantation; 3) The donor has normal renal function and the potential risk of developing nephropathy in the long term follow up is scarce (familiar nephropathies and other processes that may increase the potential risk for renal disease in the future, like severe hypertension, diabetes, etc must be ruled out). The glomerular filtrate should meet criteria for the normal function corresponding to age furthermore the absence of proteinuria and urine smear is normal; 4) The screening in the donor should contemplate those clinical situations or diseases non related to the kidney function but might elevate the surgical and/or anesthesia risk besides disease transmission to the recipient (as neoplasia or infections); 5) The surgical act is possible without technical difficulties and always performed after a negative  result of the crossmatch between donor and recipient. The living donor evaluation process will follow a different schedule based on each particular case and the center facilities. Any case, the mentioned process is divided in two parts: The first one contains an initial screening (using non invasive and low cost tests) that allows discarding contraindications for donation (in both donor and recipient). In a second phase the assessment of the donor varies with donor characteristics. However, a test for renal function is mandatory besides imaging  techniques (like angioTC), screening for transmissible diseases and a detailed evaluation for psychosocial aspects preferably made by professional. Moreover Spanish policy on living donation requires a report with information about the consent for donation developed by an independent board (ethics committee) besides the consent for donation given at the civil registry.";;Gentil Govantes MA, Pereira Palomo P;;spa;['Algorithms', 'Donor Selection/*methods', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/diagnosis', 'Kidney Function Tests', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors'];;;;10.3265/Nefrologia.pre2010.Nov.10691
5;21183959;Article;2010;Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia;;[Ethical aspects of living-donor kidney transplantation].;;UNLABELLED: Living donor kidney transplantation is considered an established treatment for end-stage renal failure and is accepted in different transplant forums, nationally and internationally, while ensuring the safety of the donation, the information, the motivation and caring, the free consent and the absence profit. SAFETY: the living donor nephrectomy is not extent of risks so a  good assessment of the donor's health status and psychosocial situation must be performed to evaluate if the benefits to donor and recipient outweigh the risks assumed. Information and Consent: to be considered ethically acceptable, the donor must be able to give his free consent to the donation after understanding the information provided, accepting the risks and benefits of organ donation, knowing the treatment alternatives for the recipient and the long-term consequences of his decision The absence of profit: offering or receiving money for an organ or other human tissue violates the principles of justice and equity  and it is considered ethically and legally unacceptable MOTIVATION: it is important to make a good psychosocial assessment to identify whether the motivation is altruistic or not and, in other terms, to detect any kind of coercion (ex, in the family). Living donation must not be offered in desperate family situations so it is important to assess family relationships to rule out the absence of freedom in donor's choice.The Role of Health Care Ethics Committees: there exists a normative in our country that regulates living donation and establishes that the hospital ethics committees should participate in the process of living donation in all cases. Their job is to assess the process and develop a report on the donor free consent to donation. The responsible person of the living transplant program should provide the documentation necessary to the committee. An interview with the potential donor can be required in some cases.;;Casares M;;spa;['Algorithms', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Records'];;;;10.3265/Nefrologia.pre2010.Nov.10687
6;21315284;Article;2011;Nuclear medicine and biology;;Biological studies in animal models using [99mTc](CO)3 recombinant annexin V as diagnostic agent of apoptotic processes.;;"INTRODUCTION: There are many diseases associated with variations in the expression of apoptosis such as organ rejection after transplantation, myocardial ischemia or infarct and neurodegenerative diseases. For this reason, the early visualization of this process is relevant to set fast and effective therapeutic strategies. METHODS: The precursor was prepared according to the procedure reported by R. Alberto, R. Schibli, P. Schubiger, U. Abram, and T. Kaden [Reactions with the technetium and rhenium carbonyl complexes (NEt(4))[MX(3)(CO)(3)]. Synthesis and structure of Tc(CN-But)(3)(CO)(3)](NO(3)) and (Net(4))[Tc(2)(mu-SCH(2)CH(2)OH)(3)(CO)(3)], Polyhedron 1996;15: 1079-89]. Recombinant annexin V was incubated with [(99m)Tc](H(2)O)3(CO)(3)(+) solution, previously neutralized with buffer. Biodistribution studies were performed in 8-week-old female Wistar rats. Animals were housed and treated in compliance with institutional guidelines related to animal experimentation. Work protocol was previously approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the university. Two groups  of rats were defined. One was used as control and the other group was previously  injected with 150 mg/kg ip of cyclophosphamide to induce apoptosis. RESULTS: The  synthesis of carbonyl precursor achieved yields higher than 90%, and the radiolabeled protein was obtained with 92% of radiochemical purity and high stability in vitro. An important uptake in apoptotic tissues was confirmed by biodistributions, scintigraphic images and histological studies. CONCLUSIONS: Biodistribution studies revealed hepatobiliary elimination, high stability in vivo and important uptake in the reticuloendothelial system. In the pathologic model, higher uptake values correspond to the liver, spleen, lungs and femur. Histological studies confirmed the development of apoptosis at 8 and 24 h postinduction in the spleen and lymphocyte bulks in the peribronchial area. Scintigraphic images confirmed high uptake both the spleen and the lungs.";;Teran MA, Martinez E, Reyes AL, Paolino A, Vital M, Esperon P, Pacheco JP, Savio E;;eng;['Animals', '*Annexin A5/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', '*Apoptosis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Animal', '*Organotechnetium Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', '*Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/pharmacokinetics'];;;;10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2010.08.007
7;21302846;Article;2010;American journal of law & medicine;;Can we handle the truth? Legal fictions in the determination of death.;;Advances in life-saving technologies in the past few decades have challenged our  traditional understandings of death. People can be maintained on life-support even after permanently losing the ability to breathe spontaneously and remaining  unconscious and unable to interact meaningfully with others. In part because this group of people could help fulfill the growing need for organ donation, there has been a great deal of pressure on the way we determine death. The determination of death has been modified from the old way of understanding death as occurring when a person stops breathing, her heart stops beating, and she is cold to the touch.  Today, physicians determine death by relying on a diagnosis of total brain failure or by waiting a short while after circulation stops. Evidence has emerged that the conceptual bases for these approaches to determining death are fundamentally flawed and depart substantially from our biological and common-sense understandings of death. We argue that the current approach to determining death consists of two different types of unacknowledged legal fictions. These legal fictions were developed for practices that are largely ethically legitimate but need to be reconciled with the law. However, the considerable debate over the determination of death in the medical and scientific literature has not informed the public of the fact that our current determinations of death do not adequately establish that a person has died. It seems unlikely that this information can remain hidden for long. Given the instability of the status quo and the difficulty of making the substantial legal  changes required by complete transparency, we argue for a second-best policy solution of acknowledging the legal fictions involved in determining death. This  move in the direction of greater transparency may someday result in allowing us to face squarely these issues and effect the legal changes necessary to permit ethically appropriate vital organ transplantation. Finally, this paper also provides the beginnings of a taxonomy of legal fictions, concluding that a more systematic theoretical treatment of legal fictions is warranted to understand their advantages and disadvantages across a variety of legal domains.;;Shah SK, Miller FG;;eng;['Advisory Committees', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Brain Death/diagnosis/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States', 'Withholding Treatment/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;Intramural NIH HHS/United States;10.1177/009885881003600402

10;21196904;Article;2010;Minerva medica;;Ethical models in bioethics: theory and application in organ allocation policies.;;Policies for allocating organs to people awaiting a transplant constitute a major ethical challenge. First and foremost, they demand balance between the principles of beneficence and justice, but many other ethically relevant principles are also involved: autonomy, responsibility, equity, efficiency, utility, therapeutic outcome, medical urgency, and so forth. Various organ allocation models can be developed based on the hierarchical importance assigned to a given principle over the others, but none of the principles should be completely disregarded. An ethically acceptable organ allocation policy must therefore be in conformity, to  a certain extent, with the requirements of all the principles. Many models for organ allocation can be derived. The utilitarian model aims to maximize benefits, which can be of various types on a social or individual level, such as the number of lives saved, prognosis, and so forth. The prioritarian model favours the neediest or those who suffer most. The egalitarian model privileges equity and justice, suggesting that all people should have an equal opportunity (casual allocation) or priority should be given to those who have been waiting longer. The personalist model focuses on each individual patient, attempting to mesh together all the various aspects affecting the person: therapeutic needs (urgency), fairness, clinical outcomes, respect for persons. In the individualistic model the main element is free choice and the system of opting-in is privileged. Contrary to the individualistic model, the communitarian model identities in the community the fundamental elements for the legitimacy of choices: therefore, the system of opting-out is privileged. This article does not aim at suggesting practical solutions. Rather, it furnishes to decision makers an overview on the possible ethical approach to this matter.;;Petrini C;;eng;['Bioethical Issues/*standards', 'Decision Making/ethics', '*Ethical Theory', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics', 'Social Justice/ethics'];;;;
11;21174684;Article;2010;Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine;;[Japanese ethos and organ transplantation from brain-dead donors].;;A trend observed since the 1980s in the Japanese academic scene is the overturning of Hippocratic ethics by American individualistic bioethics. However, the Japanese ethos is more sympathetic to personalistic bioethics rooted in Hippocratic ethics, which assumes the universal view of the 'interdependent self' clearly marked off from the 'independent self' specific to American culture. In Japan, organ transplantation from brain-dead donors is promoted despite the lack  of consensus on whether brain death signifies death of the individual. From the viewpoint of personalistic bioethics, this situation is problematic because it violates the dictum primum non nocere of the Hippocratic Oath. We should therefore first establish consensus on brain death and then promote a 'culture of donation' based on human dignity.;;Akiba E;;jpn;['Bioethics', '*Brain Death', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Japan', '*Organ Transplantation'];;;;

Although technical skills were developed primarily, it was not until immune reaction to rejection was understood and control of biological variables achieved that transplantation acquired a greater scope. Bioethical performance is currently a challenge. As a human multidisciplinary activity, this is not without bias or skew. Therefore, the social and cultural context in the deontological and bioethical sense acquire the greatest relevance, particularly when values and principles inherent to human life are taken into account along with the complex angles derived from human interactions in the bioethical triangle.

15;21143967;Article;2010;Journal of translational medicine;;Future research and therapeutic applications of human stem cells: general, regulatory, and bioethical aspects.;;There is much to be investigated about the specific characteristics of stem cells and about the efficacy and safety of the new drugs based on this type of cells, both embryonic as adult stem cells, for several therapeutic indications (cardiovascular and ischemic diseases, diabetes, hematopoietic diseases, liver diseases). Along with recent progress in transference of nuclei from human somatic cells, as well as iPSC technology, has allowed availability of lineages of all three germ layers genetically identical to those of the donor patient, which permits safe transplantation of organ-tissue-specific adult stem cells with no immune rejection. The main objective is the need for expansion of stem cell characteristics to maximize stem cell efficacy (i.e. the proper selection of a stem cell) and the efficacy (maximum effect) and safety of stem cell derived drugs. Other considerations to take into account in cell therapy will be the suitability of infrastructure and technical staff, biomaterials, production costs, biobanks, biosecurity, and the biotechnological industry. The general objectives in the area of stem cell research in the next few years, are related to identification of therapeutic targets and potential therapeutic tests, studies of cell differentiation and physiological mechanisms, culture conditions of pluripotent stem cells and efficacy and safety tests for stem cell-based drugs or procedures to be performed in both animal and human models in the corresponding clinical trials. A regulatory framework will be required to ensure patient accessibility to products and governmental assistance for their regulation and control.

This can have the effect of silencing or marginalizing other concerns, especially in the context of public engagement with science in this field. One such area of potential public concern is the donation  of oocytes and embryos to stem cell research. Contemporary research on the views  of donors and potential donors about a wide range of biomaterials, from solid organs to gametes and bone marrow, is reviewed and used to illustrate the range and types of ethical concerns articulated by this important group of stakeholders. Attitudes to donation are found to vary according to the type of tissue being donated or collected, the purpose for which donation is being sought and the nature of the recipient of the donation. Pertinently, attitudes towards donating oocytes are found to differ in some respects from donation of embryos or fetal tissue.

18;21109324;Article;2011;Journal of hepatology;;Gender, renal function, and outcomes on the liver transplant waiting list: assessment of revised MELD including estimated glomerular filtration rate.;;"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) allocation system for liver transplantation (LT) may present a disadvantage for women by including  serum creatinine, which is typically lower in females. Our objectives were to investigate gender disparities in outcomes among LT candidates and to assess a revised MELD, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), for predicting waiting list mortality. METHODS: Adults registered for LT between 2002 and 2007 were identified using the UNOS database. We compared components of MELD, MDRD-derived eGFR, and the 3-month probability of LT and death between genders. Discrimination of MELD, MELDNa, and revised models including eGFR for mortality were compared using c-statistics. RESULTS: A total of 40,393 patients (36% female) met the inclusion criteria; 9% died and 24% underwent LT within 3 months  of listing. Compared with men, women had lower median serum creatinine (0.9 vs. 1.0 mg/dl), eGFR (72 vs. 83 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), and mean MELD (16.5 vs. 17.2; all  p <0.0005), but within most MELD strata, had higher bilirubin and INR. After adjusting for relevant covariates including creatinine and body weight, women were less likely than men to receive a LT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.79-0.87) and had greater 3-month mortality (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.21). Revision of MELD and MELDNa to include eGFR did not improve discrimination for 3-month mortality (c-statistics: MELD 0.896, MELD-eGFR 0.894, MELDNa 0.911, MELDNa-eGFR 0.905).

22;21097969;Article;2010;Nursing ethics;;Nurse-focused ethical solutions to problems in organ transplantation.;;Technological developments in recent years have brought about a rapid increase in the number and variety of organ transplants, leading to problems in finding enough organs to meet the need. Organ transplantation has also become a particularly significant issue in medical ethics, especially regarding the question of how and from whom organs are procured. Many methods have been tried in order to solve these problems and discussed from an ethical perspective. This  study investigates the Spanish, Belgian and Iranian approaches to solving the organ procurement problem. The Spanish model, which is based on persuading patients and their relatives, is ethically less problematic and is also an improved version of the model applied in Turkey. This study argues that an ideal  solution can be found without disregarding ethical rules. In particular, nurses can contribute by helping to run the system more efficiently.

Currently, in the U.S., more than 100,000 persons are waiting for organ transplantation. In China, more than 1.5 million people are waiting.

Consistent with the ""dead donor rule,"" DCD is not the cause of death.There are also procedural mechanisms to address the potential conflicts of interest that concern the authors.

28;21033624;Article;2010;Bratislavske lekarske listy;;Protection of ovarian tissue from radiotherapy.;;Advances researches in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood, adolescent and adult cancer have greatly increased the life expectancy of premenopausal women with cancer. However, one of the serious side effects of these treatments is the  risk of damage to fertility. The ovaries are very sensitive to cytotoxic and radiotherapeutic treatment. The only established method of fertility preservation is embryo cryopreservation according to the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2005), but this option requires the patient to be of pubertal age, have a partner or use donor sperm, and be able to undergo a cycle of ovarian stimulation, which is not possible when the radiotherapy has to  be initiated immediately or when stimulation is contraindicated according to the  type of cancer. For patients who need immediate radiotherapy, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only possible alternative. This manuscript reports the different techniques of cryopreservation and the results of transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue. The current techniques allow cryopreservation of human ovarian fragments for a long time with good follicular survival rate after  thawing. Numerous studies ultimately in this field have demonstrated to improve the survival rate of the oocytes and cryopreserved follicles. Moreover this manuscript includes a case of a 17-year-old girl who had to undergo pelvic irradiation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the laparoscopic treatment to preserve the fertility (Fig. 2, Ref. 47).;;Pafumi C, Iraci SM, Abbate G, Clemente CM, La Rosa I, Gulino FA, Iemmola A, Randazzo C, Caldaci L, Teodoro MC, Palumbo MA, Attard M, Ciotta L, Stracquadanio MG, Messina A;;eng;['Adolescent', '*Cryopreservation/methods', 'Female', 'Fertility/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', '*Ovary/radiation effects/transplantation', 'Pelvis/radiation effects', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/methods'];;;;

This study evaluated kidney transplant survival benefit in prior nonrenal transplant recipients (kidney after liver, KALi; lung, KALu; heart, KAH) compared to primary isolated (KA1) or repeat isolated kidney (KA2) transplant. Multivariable Cox regression models were fit using UNOS data for patients wait listed and transplanted from 1995 to 2008. Compared to KA1, the risk of death on the wait list was lower for KA2 (p < 0.001;HR = 0.84;CI = 0.81-0.88), but substantially higher for KALu (p <  0.001; HR = 3.80;CI = 3.08-4.69), KAH (p < 0.001; HR = 1.92; CI = 1.66-2.22), and KALi (p < 0.001; HR = 2.69; CI = 2.46-2.95). Following kidney transplant, patient survival was greatest for KA1, similar among KA2, KALi, KAH, and inferior for KALu. Compared to the entire wait list, renal transplantation was associated with a survival benefit among all groups except KALu (p = 0.017; HR = 1.61; CI = 1.09-2.38), where posttransplant survival was inferior to the wait list population.

He was involved in the primary French kidney transplantations in 1950, and in 1952, he realized the first allotransplantation in the world of a kidney removed from a voluntary living donor. At the same time, he was the first to describe the various clinical and pathological aspects of acute rejection. He suggested the use of cortisone for the treatment of rejection as early as 1950 and promoted nonlethal body irradiation, which was successfully used in 1959 both by John Merrill in Boston and by himself in Paris, to prevent allograft rejection. In October 1962, in collaboration with Maurice Goulon, he was the first to use a kidney removed from  an individual in 'coma depasse'. He and his group contributed to transplant immunosuppression, to transplant immunology, to organ preservation, to acute and  chronic rejection pathology and so on. As early as 1956-1957, he understood the potential importance of Jean Dausset's discovery for transplantation.;;Legendre Ch, Kreis H;;eng;['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'France', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*history', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2010.03295.x

The ethical complications of assessing organ transplant candidates in the United Kingdom and the United States.;;The practice of allocating scarce organs in medicine is an ethical minefield. Due to the organ shortage, organ procurement agencies in both the United Kingdom and  the United States are placed in the unenviable position of having to choose a limited number of patients to compete equally for life-saving treatment. They do  this by composing multidisciplinary transplant teams, which must evaluate transplant candidates and their complex range of personal, medical, environmental, psychiatric and financial characteristics. During the candidate assessment process, such teams may often be torn between their moral duty to save those who are most in need, considerations of efficiency, and the battle against  forming moral judgments about particular candidates. Several ethical approaches can be adopted by transplant teams during the decision-making process, but do these ideologies provide adequate justification for their sometimes controversial decisions? This article provides a detailed examination of the ethical principles available to transplant teams in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the effect that these principles have on assessment procedures, organ allocation  protocols, transplant candidates and their prospects.;;Cherkassky L;;eng;['Donor Selection/*ethics', 'Humans', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];;;;

36;20970553;Article;2010;Transplantation proceedings;;Toward personalized medicine in renal transplantation.;;BACKGROUND: The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (TRL) are clearly affected by genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, which lead to large interindividual differences in dose-response relations. In addition, TRL has a narrow therapeutic index requiring monitoring of blood levels. The objective of the present observational, retrospective study was to associate maintenance TRL doses with various genetic markers seeking to guide optimization of the initial dose. METHODS: Results of DNA samples from 15 kidney transplant patients were correlated retrospectively with clinical information from medical records. Samples were genotyped using PHARMAchip. Association studies were performed with  chi2 and Pearson tests and by analysis of variance. The study was carried out in  accordance with international ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration and approved by our ethics committee. RESULTS: Two patient groups were identified to  show a difference in TRL dose requirements: a control (0.014-0.10 mg/kg/per day)  and an high-dose group (0.14-0.15 mg/kg/per day). The presence of CYP3A5*1 and the null allele in GSTM1 were significantly associated (P=.01 and P=.04) with the need for higher immunosuppressive doses (>0.10 mg/kg/per day). There were no differences in plasma levels of TRL or other clinical variables between the patient groups. CONCLUSION: Determination of the CYP3A5 genotype might be used to predict initial TRL requirements, although other genetic variants also provide important information to adjust the drug dose.;;Lampreabe I, Gainza de los Rios FJ, Arrieta Gutierrez A, Jofre-Monseny L, Rodriguez M, Amenabar Iribar JJ, Zarraga Larrondo S, Tejedor D, Martinez A, Olano-Martin E;;eng;['Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', '*Precision Medicine', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.08.009

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  With the approval of the Ethics Committee, the study included a total of 24 healthy piglets, average weight 30 kg (range 28-33 kg). The animals were ventilated for 90 minutes under general anaesthesia with two different tidal volume strategies and allocated into three groups. Group A, animals were healthy  controls, Group B, animals comprised 8 piglets with an abdominal aortic aneurysm  and ventilated with a low tidal volume strategy (VT(exp) 7 ml/kg). Group C comprised 8 animals seven days after kidney transplantation, ventilated with a high tidal volume strategy (VT(exp) 12 ml/kg). Changes in lung mechanics and hemodynamics were assessed at 30th and 90th minutes. Lung tissue samples were examined histologically. RESULTS: Protective ventilation in Group A and B did not confer any haemodynamic and lung mechanic differences. Significant differences were only found in Group C at 90 minutes for increased preload of both heart ventricles (CVP; t-test 4.07, p<0.01 and PAoP; t-test 8.43, p<0.01), pulmonary vascular resistance (t-test 3.11, p<0.05), and decreased expiratory tidal volume  (t-test 6.07, p<0.01), dynamic lung compliance (t-test 3.83, p<0.01) and cardiac  output (t-test 2.07, p<0.01).

39;20939691;Article;2011;Stem cells and development;;Comparative analysis of the retinal potential of embryonic stem cells and amniotic fluid-derived stem cells.;;Photoreceptors have recently been generated from mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), although ethics concerns impede their utilization for cell replacement therapy for retinal disease. Extra-embryonic tissues have received attention as alternative therapeutic sources of stem cells. Human and mouse amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFCs) have been reported to be multipotent and express embryonic and adult stem cell markers. Here, in vitro conditions that generate retinal cells from ESCs were used to analyze and compare the retinal potential of murine AFCs and ESCs. We show that AFCs express pluripotency markers (Nanog, Sox2, and Oct3/4) as well as retinal transcription factor genes (Et, Lhx2, Tll1, Six6, Otx2, Pax6, and Fgf15). AFCs from amniotic fluid of Fgf15.gfp,  Nrl.gfp, and Crx.gfp embryos cultured in retinal proliferation and differentiation conditions failed to switch on these retinal transgenes. AFCs cultured in retinal-promoting conditions, effective on ESCs, showed reduced expression of retinal markers. Retinal co-cultures activated retinal genes in ESCs but not in AFCs, and migration assays in retinal explants showed limited migration of AFCs compared with ESCs. Unlike ESCs, AFCs do not express the early  embryonic ectodermal gene Utf1 and Western analysis of AFCs identified only the B isoform of Oct3/4, rather than the isoform A present in ESCs. We conclude that AFCs have restricted potential and differ considerably from ESCs and retinal progenitor cells. Reprogramming to induce pluripotency or new differentiation protocols will be required to confer retinal potential to AFCs as expression of a subset of pluripotency and retinal markers is not sufficient.;;Decembrini S, Cananzi M, Gualdoni S, Battersby A, Allen N, Pearson RA, Ali RR, De Coppi P, Sowden JC;;eng;['Amniotic Fluid/*cytology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Culture Media/chemistry/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Organ Culture Techniques/methods', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retina/*cytology/metabolism', 'Retinal Diseases/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis'];;;G0700438/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1089/scd.2010.0291

Such behavior has been universally considered as ethically and morally reprehensible,  yet in some parts of the world the practice continues to flourish. The concept of justice demands that every person have an equal right to life, and to protect this right, society has an obligation to ensure that every person has equal access to medical care. Regrettably, the Egyptian system does not legally recognize brain death and continues to allow the buying and selling of organs. For more than 30 years in Egypt, the ability to pay has determined who receives an organ and economic need has determined who will be the donor. As transplant professionals, it is important that we advocate on behalf of all patients, potential recipients, and donors and for those who are left out and not likely to receive a donor organ in an economically based system.

Donation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from an unrelated donor, frequently residing in another country, may be the only option for 70% of those in need of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To maximize the opportunity to find the best available donor, individual donor registries collaborate internationally. To provide homogeneity of practice among registries, the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) sets standards against which registries are accredited and provides guidance and regulations about unrelated donor safety and care. A basic tenet of the donor registries is that unrelated HSC donation is an altruistic act; nonpayment of donors is entrenched in the WMDA standards and in international practice. In the  United States, the prohibition against remuneration of donors has recently been challenged. Here, we describe the reasons that the WMDA continues to believe that HSC donors should not be paid because of ethical concerns raised by remuneration, potential to damage the public will to act altruistically, the potential for coercion and exploitation of donors, increased risk to patients, harm to local transplantation programs and international stem cell exchange, and the possibility of benefiting some patients while disadvantaging others.";;Boo M, van Walraven SM, Chapman J, Lindberg B, Schmidt AH, Shaw BE, Switzer GE, Yang E, Egeland T;;eng;['*Fees and Charges', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*standards', 'Humans', 'Registries/standards', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];;;;10.1182/blood-2010-07-298430
43;20885245;Article;2010;Plastic and reconstructive surgery;;Institutional review board-based recommendations for medical institutions pursuing protocol approval for facial transplantation.;;BACKGROUND: Preliminary outcomes from the previous nine face transplants performed since 2005 have been encouraging and have therefore led to a rise in the number of medical centers interested in establishing face transplant programs worldwide. However, until now, very little literature has been published providing surgeons the necessary insight on how to (1) prepare a protocol for institutional review board approval and (2) establish a face transplant program.  METHODS: The authors' face transplant team's experience with the institutional review board at the Cleveland Clinic, beginning in 2002, was critically reviewed  in a detailed, retrospective manner. The purpose was to identify and define certain criteria necessary for both the institutional review board approval process and face transplant program establishment. RESULTS: In 2002, unprecedented efforts from within the authors' plastic surgery department led to  the world's first institutional review board approval for face transplantation, in 2004. As a result, 4 years later, the authors' face transplant team performed  the nation's first successful near-total face and maxilla transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Every surgical department hoping to establish a face transplant program must realize that this endeavor requires both tremendous financial and long-term commitments by its medical institution. These transplants should be performed only within university-based medical centers capable of orchestrating a specialized, talented, multidisciplinary team. More importantly, facial composite tissue allotransplantation possesses an unmatched level of complexity and therefore requires most centers to prepare a carefully detailed protocol using these institutional review board-based guidelines.;;Siemionow MZ, Gordon CR;;eng;['Ethics Committees, Research', 'Facial Injuries/*surgery', 'Facial Transplantation/ethics/*methods/trends', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', '*Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Male', 'Patient Selection', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181ee482d

46;20877273;Article;2010;Annals of transplantation;;Composite tissue allotransplantation in Europe. Logistics and infrastructure of a centre.;;BACKGROUND: Composite Tissue Allotransplantation (CTA) is a new medical field of  growing importance. This paper focuses on the infrastructure and organisation of  European CTA centres and discusses the differences between national health systems. MATERIAL/METHODS: Eight European centres (Valencia, Innsbruck, Munich, Lyon, Amiens, Creteil, Wroclaw, Monza) were sent with a specially-designed, standardized, 20-item questionnaire. RESULTS: Five of the eight centres returned  our questionnaire: Munich, Innsbruck, Lyon, Amiens, Wroclaw. Since 1998, CTA has  been performed at these centres. In both French centres and the Polish centre public funding is available in addition to the coverage provided by health insurers. In Munich the costs for a double upper-arm transplantation were Euro 150,000 with an additional Euro 50,000-70,000 per year. In Lyon the costs for a singular hand transplantation were Euro 70,000 per year and in Wroclaw (Poland) the costs for a hand or upper arm transplantation were Euro 20,000-30,000. As many as 17 different medical professions are involved in the CTA at the different centres. CONCLUSIONS: CTA is an innovative promising therapeutic tool that is based on the experiences of solid organ transplantation and profound microsurgical skills. Due to the complexity of the infrastructure, sourcing and the organisation CTA can only be successfully performed at specialized centres.

48;20832533;Article;2010;Transplantation proceedings;;Correlation between HLA and posttransplantation diabetes mellitus in the Han population in South China.;;"BACKGROUND: Posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common metabolic complication in renal transplant recipients. Some studies have revealed predisposing or protective HLA genes for PTDM. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of PTDM in patients in the south of China. METHODS: The present study included 195 living-donor kidney transplant recipients. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee. Each donor-recipient pair was related. Twenty-two patients had PTDM, whereas 173 did not. The frequency of each HLA phenotype was compared between these 2 groups. The 195 patients were divided into 2 groups according to immunosuppression regimen, a cyclosporine group and a tacrolimus group, and the incidence of PTDM was compared between the groups. Patients were then subdivided into 2 groups according to age, an elderly group (age 40 years or older) and a younger group (age younger than 40 years), and the incidence of PTDM was calculated and compared between these 2 groups. RESULTS: HLA-A30 and HLA-DR7  seem to be predisposing genes for PTDM in patients in the south of China; Low dosages of calcineurin inhibitors were used in our center, There was no significant difference in the incidence of PTDM between the CsA and Tac groups; The incidence of PTDM in the elderly group was significantly higher than that in  the younger group. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving HLA-A30 and HLA-DR7 antigens, and elderly patients are at higher risk of developing PTDM.

49;20831719;Article;2010;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society;;How should we use age to ration health care? Lessons from the case of kidney transplantation.;;Competing visions for health reform in the United States and renewed interest in  health technology assessment (HTA) have led to fierce national debates about the  appropriateness of rationing. Because of a limited supply of organs, kidney transplantation has always required rationing and overt discussion of the ethics  that guide it, but the field of transplantation has also contended recently with  internal calls for a new rationing system. The aim of the Life Years from Transplantation (LYFT) proposal is to allocate kidneys to patients who obtain the greatest survival benefit from transplantation, which would lengthen the lives of kidney transplant recipients but restrict the ability of older Americans to obtain a transplant. The debate around the LYFT proposal reveals the ethical and  policy challenges of identifying which patients should receive a treatment based  on the results of cost-effectiveness and other HTA studies. This article argues that attempts to use HTA for healthcare rationing are likely to disadvantage older patients. Guiding principles to help ensure that resources such as kidneys  are justly allocated across the life span are proposed.;;Reese PP, Caplan AL, Bloom RD, Abt PL, Karlawish JH;;eng;['Aged', '*Aging', 'Geriatric Assessment/*methods', 'Government Agencies', 'Health Care Rationing/*organization & administration', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];;;K23 DK078688/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03031.x

54;20811223;Article;2010;Plastic and reconstructive surgery;;Ethical considerations in the first American face transplant.;;BACKGROUND: Before performing the first face transplant in the United States, the authors addressed several ethical considerations: subject selection, adequacy of  informed consent, and risk-to-benefit analysis. METHODS: Destruction of the patient's midface, including its bony architecture, had impaired the ability of the authors' patient to speak, eat, smell, and socialize. These functional impairments and the inability of conventional reconstruction to reconstruct this  deformity justified considering this patient for face transplantation. The patient's resilience in adapting to her injury, her conscientious self-care following her initial injury, and her ability to understand the risks and uncertainties of the proposed procedure were important factors in selecting her as a candidate for this innovation. To enhance our patient's understanding of this largely untried procedure, the informed consent process occurred over multiple encounters involving both information disclosure and assessment of comprehension of what the procedure involved, including its potential benefits and risks. The patient demonstrated not only understanding of the procedure, including its innovative nature and concomitant uncertainties, but also that its  goals were consistent with her values. RESULTS: Research risk-to-benefit analysis involved balancing societal and subject benefits against subject risks. The potential benefit to society and increased knowledge of the role of face transplantation in facial reconstruction were substantial. The subject's benefits had been maximized and harms minimized through subject selection, team expertise, and preparation. This produced a risk-to-benefit profile in which we considered that the benefits sufficiently outweighed the risks to proceed with transplantation in this patient. CONCLUSION: Ethical considerations were important determinants in the decision to proceed with facial transplantation in  this woman.;;Paradis C, Siemionow M, Papay F, Lohman R, Kodish E, Gordon C, Djohan R, Coffman K, Bernard S, Alam D;;eng;['Facial Transplantation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Patient Selection', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0b013e3181e3b63d
55;20799051;Article;2010;HEC forum : an interdisciplinary journal on hospitals' ethical and legal issues;;Do no harm: a defense of markets in healthcare.;;This paper argues that the rules that constitute a market protect autonomy and increase welfare in healthcare. Markets do the former through protecting rights to self-ownership and a cluster of rights that protect its exercise. Markets protect welfare by organizing and protecting trades. In contrast, prohibition destroys legitimate markets, giving rise to so-called black markets that harm both the autonomy and well-being of agents. For example, a fee-for-service medical system is a highly developed and specialized market. It is individuals working together, through the division of labor, to provide mutual insurance. This coordination, and the benefits it makes possible, is not possible without injunctions against harm. Prohibitions on harm are not mere ethical niceties, they are practice rules for both healthcare and markets. Placing the doctor within a healthcare market actually reinforces the doctor's moral obligation, and the legal enforcement of that obligation, not to harm. Similarly, markets reinforce patient rights to self-determination through legal and institutional enforcement of the harm principle in the form of the protection of certain basic  welfare rights to life, bodily integrity, property, trade, and contract. Since the establishment of markets protects agent autonomy and welfare, and prohibition directly harms the same, there are strong reasons for establishing markets to protect trade in precisely those areas where autonomy and well-being are most vulnerable to exploitation, for example, the trade in human kidneys.;;Kline W;;eng;"['Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Fraud', '*Harm Reduction', '*Health Care Sector', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Personal Autonomy', ""Physician's Role"", 'Tissue and Organ Procurement']";;;;10.1007/s10730-010-9140-7

Development of the concept of brain death coincided with advances in  medical technology that facilitated artificial ventilation and organ transplantation. More recently, the process of ""timed"" death with subsequent organ donation (controlled donation after cardiac death transplantation) has raised controversial questions having to do with the limits of treatments that facilitate organ transplant but might hasten death, and the duration of cardiac arrest necessary for declaration of death and the commencement of organ procurement.

59;20731646;Article;2012;Bioethics;;Arguments against promoting organ transplants from brain-dead donors, and views of contemporary Japanese on life and death.;;As of 2009, the number of donors in Japan is the lowest among developed countries. On July 13, 2009, Japan's Organ Transplant Law was revised for the first time in 12 years. The revised and old laws differ greatly on four primary points: the definition of death, age requirements for donors, requirements for brain-death determination and organ extraction, and the appropriateness of priority transplants for relatives. In the four months of deliberations in the National Diet before the new law was established, various arguments regarding brain death and organ transplantation were offered. An amazing variety of opinions continue to be offered, even after more than 40 years have elapsed since the first heart organ transplant in Japan. Some are of the opinion that with the  passage of the revised law, Japan will finally become capable of performing transplants according to global standards. Contrarily, there are assertions that  organ transplants from brain-dead donors are unacceptable because they result in  organs being taken from living human beings. Considering the current conditions,  we will organize and introduce the arguments for and against organ transplants from brain-dead donors in contemporary Japan. Subsequently, we will discuss the primary arguments against organ transplants from brain-dead donors from the perspective of contemporary Japanese views on life and death. After introducing the recent view that brain death should not be regarded as equivalent to the death of a human being, we would like to probe the deeply-rooted views on life and death upon which it is based.;;Asai A, Kadooka Y, Aizawa K;;eng;['Attitude to Death/*ethnology', 'Brain Death/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1111/j.1467-8519.2010.01839.x

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following approval of the local ethics committee, 24 renal allograft recipients and 10 control subjects (healthy volunteers) were included in this study. Multi-echo T2 and T2* imaging was performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Allograft recipients were assigned to two groups: group a), 8 patients with good (glomerular filtration rate of more than 40 ml/min) allograft function and no evidence of transplant rejection, transplant renal artery stenosis or ureteral obstruction; group b), 16 patients with deterioration of renal graft function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 40 ml/min or less). Two different imaging protocols were tested. RESULTS: The mean T2' relaxation parameters were 108.33 msec +/- 13.34, 100.00 msec +/- 18.89 and 124.57 msec +/- 6.51 for groups a), b) and for control subjects, respectively. The reduction of T2' values in patient group b) was not statistically significant. However, significant correlations could be demonstrated between T2'  values and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of renal allograft function. The  reproducibility was tested and the coefficients of variation of T2' values in the cortex of transplanted kidneys were 11.1% within subjects and 11.3% between subjects. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that T2' imaging is a promising non-enhanced technique, which seems to reveal information on transplant function.

However, the use of animal organs and the personnel involved in its implementation could face  opposition. Our objective was to analyze the attitudes of veterinary degree students in a Spanish university toward xenotransplantation and to determine the  factors that affect its acceptance. METHODS: Of the 515 students registered in a  veterinary degree course (2007-2008), we surveyed 482 94% of whom completed the questionnaire. Attitudes toward organ xenotransplantation were evaluated using a  validated, self-administered questionnaire concerning organ donation, which was completed anonymously.

RESULTS: If xenotransplantation was confirmed as a clinical reality, 91% (n = 436) of those students surveyed would accept a xenotransplanted organ, whereas 9% (n = 46) would not. Furthermore, 95% (n = 457) would accept tissue xenotransplantation and 97% (n = 467) cell xenotransplantation.

In populations where there are preclinical projects there is the possibility of xenotransplantation to humans. In the South East of Spain in recent years there has been a significant social change, due to the migratory influx, which is making it necessary to reconsider the level of acceptance of xenotransplantation. The objective of this study was to analyze the attitudes of  and to determine relevant variables among the population from southeastern Spain  who were born in Scotland. METHOD: A random sample of the population from the South East of Spain that was born in Scotland. (n = 350) answered a questionnaire with categories validated for our geographical area. The self-administered survey was completed anonymously between November 2005 and March 2006. The statistical analysis employed Student's t-test, the chi(2) test, and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The questionnaire completion rate was 93% (n = 325). Assuming the results were comparable with those obtained using human organs, most respondents  (67%) favored xenotransplantation with 8% against and 25% undecided. With regard  to xenotransplantation, if the results were worse than those achieved using human organs, 26% (n = 83) would be in favor, 55% (n = 178) undecided, and the remaining 19% (n = 62) against these procedures. The attitude was related to belonging to the male gender (P < .001), marital status (P = .008), level of education (P = .041), a partner's favorable attitude toward transplantation (P <  .001), and a favorable attitude toward organ donation, either from a deceased (P  = .001) or a living (P < .001) donor.

Arguments against this procedure include risks of immunosuppression, the concern that it will be done for cosmesis, the belief that acceptable reconstruction can be achieved with autologous tissues, the potential impact on the patient of graft failure, and the concern that the procedure may be adopted by unqualified centers. If we look to bioethics to help us dissect the question of whether or not facial transplantation should be performed, we see that the majority of the arguments have been proscriptive rather than prescriptive.

In  the field of pediatric transplantation, these ethical dilemmas can be even more profound than in adults.

76;20642177;Article;2010;Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.);;Too poor for transplant: finance and insurance issues in transplant ethics.;;CONTEXT: Donor organs are a scarce gift. Additionally, transplantation is very expensive and the United States lacks universal health insurance for all citizens. These facts combine to make personal finance and insurance some of the  criteria for wait listing at US transplant centers. Previous research has shown that the poor and the uninsured (as well as women and nonwhites) are less likely  to receive a transplant. Living donor candidates are also limited by the US insurance system. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of finance and insurance variables on access to transplant and living donation. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of ethics consultation data contained in a research registry approved by the institutional review board at California Pacific Medical Center.  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study analyzes research registry data from a large community hospital in Northern California that serves patients from California, Oregon, and Nevada. The registry data are derived from transplant ethics consultations occurring between January 1, 2007, and June 30, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURE: This study explores the restriction of access to transplantation and of  participation in living donation. RESULTS: More than a quarter of all transplant  ethics consultation reports described the restriction of transplant-related treatment for reasons rooted in finance or insurance. Individuals on the recipient side and on the donor side were hindered with regard to access. Insurance status and personal ability to pay significantly affect access to transplantation in the United States, and this theme is a frequent feature of ethics consultations at California Pacific Medical Center.;;Laurentine KA, Bramstedt KA;;eng;['California', 'Health Services Accessibility/*economics', 'Humans', '*Insurance Coverage', 'Living Donors/supply & distribution', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics/*ethics', '*Poverty'];;;;10.7182/prtr.20.2.xhu0678655331488

Today's consciousness about growing older  is partly shaped by a new form of ethics, constituted by and enabled through the  routines and institutions that comprise ordinary clinical care. Unlike bioethics, whose emphasis is on clinical decision-making in individual situations, this new  form of ethics is exceptionally diffuse and can be characterized as an ethical field. It is located in and shaped by health-care policies, standard technologies, and clinical evidence, and it emerges in what patients and families come to need and want. Three developments illustrate this ethical field at work:  the changing nature of disease, especially the ascent of risk awareness and risk-based strategies for life extension; the role of technology in reshaping the ends of medicine; and the role of Medicare policy in creating need and ethical necessity. Medicare's expanding criteria for payment coverage of liver transplantation and implantable cardiac devices illustrate the pervasive logic of this new form of ethics. The powerful connection between the technological imperative and its ethical necessity is rarely mentioned in Medicare reform debates.";;Kaufman SR;;eng;['*Aging', 'Biomedical Technology/ethics', 'Defibrillators, Implantable', '*Ethics', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/ethics', '*Longevity', 'Medicare/*organization & administration/standards', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Pacemaker, Artificial', 'Philosophy, Medical', 'Risk Assessment/ethics', 'United States'];;;R01 AG028426/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;10.1353/pbm.0.0164

Although several criticisms have been raised on this issue, these criteria have persisted without any empirical data showing the opinions and attitudes of people who are affected by the revision. Therefore, we performed a questionnaire survey to determine what Japanese medical professionals involved with living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) regarded as eligible relationships for donation, as well as the kind of relationship for which they would be willing to donate their liver, and what donor eligibility criteria was currently used by their institutions. Among the 71 representatives of the Japanese Liver Transplantation Society, >90% answered that liver donations to emotionally close parents, siblings, children, or spouses were acceptable. However, the numbers were considerably lower for donation to emotionally close blood relatives, in-laws, friends, and strangers (78.2%, 52.1%, 18.6%, and 5.9%,  respectively). This gap was more prominent when participants were questioned about their own willingness to donate. More than two-thirds of facilities that perform LDLTs have independent regulations for donor eligibility that are more conservative than the JST guidelines. No facility accepted friends or strangers as donors. When introducing policies or guidelines, it is important to carefully  investigate the views of the people who are affected. The data obtained in this study should serve as a resource for ongoing discussions about the JST revised guidelines.";;Fujita M, Matsui K, Monden M, Akabayashi A;;eng;['Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Female', 'Hepatectomy/methods', 'Hospital Bed Capacity', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Liver Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Medical Staff, Hospital/psychology', 'Patient Selection', 'Surveys and Questionnaires'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.12.072

Most patients in the UK cannot enjoy the benefits of a transplant because of an extreme shortage of organs. This paper demonstrates the magnitude of the problem of organ shortage and identifies possible causes. The current UK legislation regarding consent to organ transplantation is analysed and compared with other jurisdictions. The hypothesis of changing the legislation to a system of presumed consent in order to address the organ shortage is explored. The main issues surrounding a change in the legislation are considered, and the effects on society and the individual  are discussed. This paper argues that there is not enough convincing evidence to  support a change in the legislation to a system of presumed consent at this time. Instead, an increase in organ donations could be achieved by improving the effectiveness of the current system of organ donation, and by improving the public's awareness and understanding of organ transplantation issues.;;Simillis C;;eng;['Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Presumed Consent/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United Kingdom'];;;;10.1258/msl.2010.009016

97;20459428;Article;2012;Bioethics;;Should we allow organ donation euthanasia? Alternatives for maximizing the number and quality of organs for transplantation.;;There are not enough solid organs available to meet the needs of patients with organ failure. Thousands of patients every year die on the waiting lists for transplantation. Yet there is one currently available, underutilized, potential source of organs. Many patients die in intensive care following withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment whose organs could be used to save the lives of others. At present the majority of these organs go to waste. In this paper we consider and evaluate a range of ways to improve the number and quality of organs available from this group of patients. Changes to consent arrangements (for example conscription of organs after death) or changes to organ donation practice could dramatically increase the numbers of organs available, though they would conflict with currently accepted norms governing transplantation. We argue that one alternative, Organ Donation Euthanasia, would be a rational improvement over  current practice regarding withdrawal of life support. It would give individuals  the greatest chance of being able to help others with their organs after death. It would increase patient autonomy. It would reduce the chance of suffering during the dying process. We argue that patients should be given the choice of whether and how they would like to donate their organs in the event of withdrawal of life support in intensive care. Continuing current transplantation practice comes at the cost of death and prolonged organ failure. We should seriously consider all of the alternatives.;;Wilkinson D, Savulescu J;;eng;['Advance Directive Adherence', 'Brain Death', 'Euthanasia, Active/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Withholding Treatment'];;;086041/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom;10.1111/j.1467-8519.2010.01811.x
98;20457616;Article;2010;The Journal of medicine and philosophy;;Death revisited: rethinking death and the dead donor rule.;;Traditionally, people were recognized as being dead using cardio-respiratory criteria: individuals who had permanently stopped breathing and whose heart had permanently stopped beating were dead. Technological developments in the middle of the twentieth century and the advent of the intensive care unit made it possible to sustain cardio-respiratory and other functions in patients with severe brain injury who previously would have lost such functions permanently shortly after sustaining a brain injury. What could and should physicians caring  for such patients do? Significant advances in human organ transplantation also played direct and indirect roles in discussions regarding the care of such patients. Because successful transplantation requires that organs be removed from cadavers shortly after death to avoid organ damage due to loss of oxygen, there has been keen interest in knowing precisely when people are dead so that organs could be removed. Criteria for declaring death using neurological criteria developed, and today a whole brain definition of death is widely used and recognized by all 50 states in the United States as an acceptable way to determine death.

Events in 2009 that were dedicated toward achieving a lifetime immunosuppressive benefit were complicated by legislative challenges and a dynamic that placed oral medications in the ESRD bundling proposal in direct conflict with the potential for the lifetime immunosuppressive benefit. In line with its mission, the NKF could not sacrifice one kidney patient constituency for another. Successful patient-centered organizations stay consistent with their mission. The NKF had to weigh the risk of postponing a long-sought goal and its relationships with other organizations with standards of patient safety and equitable and efficient patient care.

Is it now time to take this controversial issue seriously? If the 2009 Bill provides a window into the future, what practical and ethical difficulties will this new presumed consent legislation impart upon our current organ procurement system?

101;20439358;Article;2010;The Journal of medicine and philosophy;;Constructing the death elephant: a synthetic paradigm shift for the definition, criteria, and tests for death.;;"In debates about criteria for human death, several camps have emerged, the main two focusing on either loss of the ""organism as a whole"" (the mainstream view) or loss of consciousness or ""personhood."" Controversies also rage over the proper definition of ""irreversible"" in criteria for death. The situation is reminiscent  of the proverbial blind men palpating an elephant; each describes the creature according to the part he can touch. Similarly, each camp grasps some aspect of the complex reality of death. The personhood camp, in contrast to the mainstream  ""organism"" camp, recognizes that a human organism can still be a biological living whole even without brain function. The mainstream camp, in contrast to the personhood camp, recognizes that a person can be permanently, even irreversibly unconscious, and still be a living person so long as his/her body is alive. The author proposes that hylomorphic dualism incorporates both these key insights. But to complete the picture of the entire ""death elephant,"" a fundamental paradigm shift is needed to make sense of other seemingly conflicting insights. The author proposes a ""semantic bisection"" of the concept of death, analogous to  the traditional distinction at the beginning of life between ""conception"" and ""birth."" To avoid the semantic baggage associated with the term ""death,"" the two  new death-related concepts are referred to as ""passing away"" (or ""deceased"") and  ""deanimation,"" corresponding, respectively, to sociolegal ceasing-to-be (mirror image of birth) and ontological/theological ceasing-to-be of the bodily organism  (mirror image of conception). Regarding criteria, the distinguishing feature is whether the cessation of function is permanent (passing away) or irreversible (deanimation). If the ""dead donor rule"" were renamed the ""deceased donor rule"" (both acronyms felicitously being ""DDR""), the ethics of organ transplantation from non-heart-beating donors could, in principle, be validly governed by the DDR, even though the donors are not yet ontologically ""deanimated."" Thus, the paradigm shift satisfies both those who insist on maintaining the DDR and those who claim that it has all along been receiving only lip service and should be explicitly loosened to include those who are ""as good as dead."" Even so, a number of practical caveats remain to be worked out for non-heart-beating protocols.";;Shewmon DA;;eng;['Animals', 'Attitude to Death', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Brain/physiology', 'Brain Death/*diagnosis', '*Death', 'Decapitation', 'Humans', 'Personhood', '*Tissue Donors', 'Unconsciousness'];;;;10.1093/jmp/jhq022

Nevertheless, scholars have argued cogently that donors of vital organs, including those diagnosed as ""brain dead"" and those  declared dead according to cardiopulmonary criteria, are not in fact dead at the  time that vital organs are being procured. In this article, we challenge the normative rationale for the DDR by rejecting the underlying premise that it is necessarily wrong for physicians to cause the death of patients and the claim that abandoning this rule would exploit vulnerable patients. We contend that it is ethical to procure vital organs from living patients sustained on life support prior to treatment withdrawal, provided that there is valid consent for both withdrawing treatment and organ donation. However, the conservatism of medical ethics and practical concerns make it doubtful that the DDR will be abandoned in  the near future.

Although this criterion can be compatible with transplantation of most organs, it is not compatible with heart transplantation since heart transplants by definition involve the resuscitation of the supposedly ""irreversibly"" stopped heart. Subsequently, the definition of ""irreversible"" has been altered so as to permit heart transplantation in some circumstances, but this is unsatisfactory. There are three available strategies for solving this ""irreversibility problem"": altering the definition of death so as to rely on circulatory irreversibility, rather than cardiac; defining death strictly on the basis of brain death (either  whole-brain or more pragmatically some higher brain criteria); or redefining death in traditional terms and simultaneously legalizing some limited instances of medical killing to procure viable hearts. The first two strategies are the most ethically justifiable and practical.";;Veatch RM;;eng;['*Bioethical Issues', 'Brain Death/*diagnosis', '*Death', '*Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Life Support Care', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Harvesting', 'Withholding Treatment'];;;;10.1093/jmp/jhq020

105;20430154;Article;2010;Transplantation proceedings;;Organ donation after cardiac death in the Middle East.;;INTRODUCTION: The shortage of organ donors along with the increased number of waiting recipients have created the need for new strategies to expand the organ pool: living donors, split livers, domino livers, and organs from donations after cardiac death (DCD). The purpose of this article was to focus upon aspects of DCD application in the religious, traditional, ethical, and legal aspects of the Arab world. BACKGROUND: DCD can increase the donor pool by 15%-25%. Several ethical, legal, and social concerns need to be addressed to make DCD more widely accepted  by the general population in Western countries as well as in the Middle East. Organs from DCD donors have been transplanted since the 1960s. As soon as brain death criteria were published in 1968, organ retrieval from cadaveric heart-beating donors predominated. Donation after brain death (DBD) almost completely replaced DCD. In the 1990s, the organ shortage led to DCD in many countries, but not in the Arab world. DCD is still not accepted by most in the Arab world due to religious, ethical, social, and legal issues. CONCLUSION: DCD in the Arab world is more complicated than in Western countries. It should be re-evaluated and thoroughly reviewed with the new criteria for DCD and its implementation in our region.;;Faraj W, Fakih H, Mukherji D, Khalife M;;eng;['Arabs/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Brain Death', 'Cadaver', 'Death', 'Death, Sudden, Cardiac/*epidemiology', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Legislation, Medical', 'Middle East/epidemiology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/standards/*statistics & numerical data'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.02.058

108;20395871;Article;2010;Journal of thoracic imaging;;Gravitational gradients in expiratory computed tomography examinations of patients with small airways disease: effect of body position on extent of air trapping.;;"PURPOSE: First, to test the hypothesis that air trapping in diseased patients follows a gravitational gradient and is more extensive in dependent than in nondependent lung regions. Second, to test the hypothesis that the dependent lung regions on combined supine and prone expiratory computed tomography (CT) examinations will show more air trapping than would a supine expiratory CT examination alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this ethics committee-approved study, supine and prone multidetector-row CT (4x1 mm collimation, 0.5 s rotation  time, 140 kVp, and effective 80 mAs) was performed at full end-expiration on 47 lung transplant recipients (mean age 41+/-12 y; 18 without bronchiolitis, 18 with potential bronchiolitis, and 11 with bronchiolitis). The extent of air trapping was visually quantified in the supine and prone positions, and in dependent and nondependent lung regions. Individual air trapping scores from these regions were thus available and could be combined for later analysis. Differences in the extent of air trapping between the positions and regions were tested with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: Air trapping was significantly more extensive in the combined dependent lung regions than in the combined nondependent lung regions (15.00% vs. 5.77%; P<0.001). Air trapping was also significantly more extensive in the combined dependent regions than in the supine body position (15.00% vs. 7.50%; P<0.001). No statistically significant difference in the extent of air trapping was found between the supine and the prone positions (7.50% vs. 12.14%; P=0.735). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected or overt small airways disease, air trapping follows a gravitational gradient. A change from the supine to the prone position can make air trapping visible in formerly nondependent lung regions. The combined readings from supine and prone CT examinations in dependent lung regions show more air trapping than a standard supine CT examination alone.";;Bankier AA, Estenne M, Kienzl D, Muller-Mang C, Van Muylem A, Gevenois PA;;eng;['Adult', 'Air', 'Bronchiolitis Obliterans/*diagnostic imaging', 'Exhalation', 'Female', '*Gravitation', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observer Variation', '*Posture', 'Prone Position', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Supine Position', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1097/RTI.0b013e3181cbc28b
109;20394110;Article;2010;Bioethics;;Trading with the waiting-list: the justice of living donor list exchange.;;In a Living Donor List Exchange program, the donor makes his kidney available for allocation to patients on the postmortal waiting-list and receives in exchange a  postmortal kidney, usually an O-kidney, to be given to the recipient he favours.  The program can be a solution for a candidate donor who is unable to donate directly or to participate in a paired kidney exchange because of blood group incompatibility or a positive cross-match. Each donation within an LDLE program makes an additional organ available for transplantation. But because most of the  pairs making use of the program will be A/O incompatible, it will also tend to increase the waiting time for patients with blood group O, who already have the longest waiting time. It has therefore been objected that the program is materially unjust, because it further disadvantages the least advantaged. This objection appeals to John Rawls' difference principle. However, the context for which Rawls proposed that difference principle, is significantly different from the present one. Applying the principle here amounts to a lop-sided trade-off between considerations of need and considerations of overall utility. Considerations of formal justice, however, may lead to a stronger objection to LDLE programs. Such a program means that one O-patient on the waiting list is exempted from the application of the general criteria used in constructing the list because he has a special bargaining advantage. This objection is spelled out and weighed against the obvious attraction of LDLE in a situation of (extreme) organ scarcity.;;den Hartogh G;;eng;['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors/supply & distribution', '*Social Justice', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/organization & administration', '*Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00684.x

114;20380726;Article;2010;BMC medical ethics;;The use of personalized medicine for patient selection for renal transplantation: physicians' views on the clinical and ethical implications.;;BACKGROUND: The overwhelming scarcity of organs within renal transplantation forces researchers and transplantation teams to seek new ways to increase efficacy. One of the possibilities is the use of personalized medicine, an approach based on quantifiable and scientific factors that determine the global immunological risk of rejection for each patient. Although this approach can improve the efficacy of transplantations, it also poses a number of ethical questions. METHODS: The qualitative research involved 22 semi-structured interviews with nephrologists involved in renal transplantation, with the goal of determining the professionals' views about calculating the global immunological risk and the attendant ethical issues. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a general acceptance of this approach amongst the participants in the study. Knowledge of each patient's immunological risk could improve treatment and the post-graft follow-up. On the other hand, the possibility that patients might be excluded from transplantation poses a significant ethical issue. This approach is not seen as something entirely new, given the fact that medicine is increasingly scientific and evidence-based. Although renal transplantation incorporates scientific data, these physicians believe that there should always be a place for clinical judgment and the physician-patient relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The participants see the benefits of including the calculation of the global immunological risk within transplantation. Such data, being more precise and rigorous, could be of help in their clinical work. However, in spite of the use of such scientific data, a place must be retained for the clinical judgment that  allows a physician to make decisions based on medical data, professional expertise and knowledge of the patient. To act in the best interests of the patient is key to whether the calculation of the global immunological risk is employed.;;Dion-Labrie M, Fortin MC, Hebert MJ, Doucet H;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'Ethics, Clinical', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Judgment', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', 'Physicians/*statistics & numerical data', 'Precision Medicine/ethics/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quebec', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Uncertainty'];;;;10.1186/1472-6939-11-5

116;20375881;Article;2010;Current opinion in anaesthesiology;;Anesthetic optimization for nonheartbeating donors.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: One of the newest strategies to enlarge the pool of organ donors is to consider the category of donors after cardiac death rather than only after brain death. Prompt and accurate identification of potential donors and appropriate care is necessary to optimize the management of nonheartbeating donors. RECENT FINDINGS: Organ procurement derived from donors after cardiac death is becoming a part of the policy of major transplantation hospitals, forcing them to consider the practical interventions and ethical implications regarding this practice. Typical donors are patients affected by irreversible brain injuries, high spinal cord injury and end-stage musculoskeletal diseases. To start the process the following three conditions must be met. Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies must be considered independently from transplantation.  Withdrawal of life support requires a careful titration of the drugs controlling  pain, anxiety and discomfort. Organ harvesting has to be initiated after at least 2-5 min of confirmed cardiac death. SUMMARY: In order to increase the number of organs available for transplantation, donation from nonheartbeating donors has been recently proposed. Identification of the key aspects of the donation after cardiac death should be fully achieved by the team involved in the transplantation program. Development of hospital policies and identification of receivers who are most likely to benefit from this strategy require further studies to assess long-term outcome and to identify ethical aspects concerning different religious and cultural backgrounds.;;Fanelli V, Mascia L;;eng;['Anesthesia/*methods', '*Death', 'Humans', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/methods'];;;;10.1097/ACO.0b013e3283395352

118;20364454;Article;2010;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Transplant tourism.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Because of the ongoing organ donor shortage, transplant tourism is occurring at an increasing rate both in the USA and abroad. To date, there have been little published data to help guide the programmatic philosophy of the USA transplant centers regarding transplant tourism. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarize position statements from several transplant societies regarding transplant tourism and specifically transplantation occurring in China (because of the use of executed prisoners as organ donors). Transplant tourism is ever increasing and patients may be at risk for greater post-transplant morbidity as well as inadequate follow up care. Transplant centers require some guidance with  regard of how to deal with these patients. SUMMARY: Transplant tourism is an increasing reality facing the USA transplant centers. Most professional societies do not condone it yet cannot abrogate a physician's right to care for such patients. Ethical principles mandate transplant physicians provide adequate care  for returning transplant tourists. Better ways of assessing the scope of the problem are necessary. Transplant tourism may exist because of the disparity between the need for organ donors and their availability and is thus is likely to continue into the future.;;Schiano TD, Rhodes R;;eng;['Attitude of Health Personnel', 'China', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', '*Medical Tourism/ethics/psychology', '*Organ Transplantation/adverse effects/ethics/psychology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Public Opinion', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/psychology/*supply & distribution', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/mot.0b013e328337353e

This paper aims to take a 'deep-look' at Harris' works to argue that it is  possible to find some principles of Islamic ethics in Harrisian philosophy, namely in his major works, as well as in his personal life. This may be surprising, or thought of as a 'big' and 'groundless' claim, since John Harris has nothing to do with any religion in his intellectual works. The major features of Harrisian philosophy could be defined as consequentialism or utilitarianism with liberal overtones. Despite some significant and fundamental differences in the application of principles (ie, abortion, euthanasia), the similarities between the major principles in Harrisian philosophy and Islamic ethics are greater at some points than the similarities between Islamic ethics and some other religious ethics (ie, Christian, Judaism). In this study I compare Harrisian teachings with major Islamic principles on 'Responsibility', 'Side-effects and Double-effects', 'Equality', 'Vicious choice, guilt and innocence', 'Organ transplantation and property rights' and 'Advance directives'.;;Aksoy S;;eng;['*Bioethics', 'Ethical Theory/history', '*Ethics, Medical', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', '*Islam', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Philosophy, Medical/*history', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Social Justice'];;;;10.1136/jme.2009.034389

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews; content analysis of specific parts of the interviews; frequency distributions of resulting categories. SAMPLE: Forty-five adults aged 18-42 years (mean: 32 +/- 5.5 years).  Post-transplant survival ranged from 1 to 11 years. RESULTS: The majority of recipients (60%) fulfilled criteria of denial towards the foreign organ and/or the donor. However, they were rather sensitive towards the ethical and psychological impact of the upcoming option of living donorship in LTx. Also, the majority of recipients (79%) understood that there might as well be good reason not to opt for a LTx.

During the DCD process, a patient was monitored with processed electroencephalogram (EEG), which showed considerable changes traditionally associated with lighter planes of anesthesia immediately after withdrawal of care. Subsequently, to validate the findings of this case, processed EEG was recorded during 2 other cases in which care was withdrawn without the use of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs. We found that changes in processed EEG immediately after withdrawal of care were not only reproducible, but can happen in the absence of changes in major electromyographic or electrocardiographic artifact. It is well documented that processed EEG is prone  to artifacts. However, in the setting of DCD, these changes in processed EEG deserve some consideration. If these changes are not due to artifact, dosing of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs might be warranted.

However, guidelines for living kidney donor evaluation are absent in China. The aim of this study is to describe the initial  experience in the living kidney donor evaluation process in a single transplant center in China. METHODS: The evaluation process of our center is sequentially divided into five steps: outpatient consultation and information, preliminary evaluation, comprehensive evaluation, final informed consent, and ethics committee oversight. RESULTS: Between June 2007 and March 2009, 124 potential living donors were evaluated in our center, of whom 82 (66.1%) became effective donors and the remaining 42 (33.9%) were excluded. The exclusion reasons were related to clinical problems in 27 cases, psychosocial problems in seven cases, and suspected organ trading in eight cases. CONCLUSION: Although strongly forbidden by Chinese laws, organ trading remains a threat to the healthy development of LRDKT in China. To prohibit organ trading, the kinship between the donor and recipient should be carefully identified. Guidelines for living donor evaluation appropriate to the actual situation in China should be set up for the  sake of safety and to protect the rights and interests of both donors and recipients.;;Zhao WY, Zhang L, Han S, Zhu YH, Wang LM, Zhou MS, Zeng L;;eng;['Adult', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Male', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01229.x
124;20232039;Article;2010;Intensive care medicine;;Imminent brain death: point of departure for potential heart-beating organ donor  recognition.;;PURPOSE: There is, in European countries that conduct medical chart review of intensive care unit (ICU) deaths, no consensus on uniform criteria for defining a potential organ donor. Although the term is increasingly being used in recent literature, it is seldom defined in detail. We searched for criteria for determination of imminent brain death, which can be seen as a precursor for organ donation. METHODS: We organized meetings with representatives from the field of clinical neurology, neurotraumatology, intensive care medicine, transplantation medicine, clinical intensive care ethics, and organ procurement management. During these meetings, all possible criteria were discussed to identify a patient with a reasonable probability to become brain dead (imminent brain death). We focused on the practical usefulness of two validated coma scales (Glasgow Coma Scale and the FOUR Score), brain stem reflexes and respiration to define imminent brain death. Further we discussed criteria to determine irreversibility and futility in acute neurological conditions. RESULTS: A patient who fulfills the definition of imminent brain death is a mechanically ventilated deeply comatose patient, admitted to an ICU, with irreversible catastrophic brain damage of known origin. A condition of imminent brain death requires either a Glasgow Coma Score  of 3 and the progressive absence of at least three out of six brain stem reflexes or a FOUR score of E(0)M(0)B(0)R(0). CONCLUSION: The definition of imminent brain death can be used as a point of departure for potential heart-beating organ donor recognition on the intensive care unit or retrospective medical chart analysis.;;de Groot YJ, Jansen NE, Bakker J, Kuiper MA, Aerdts S, Maas AI, Wijdicks EF, van Leiden HA, Hoitsma AJ, Kremer BH, Kompanje EJ;;eng;['Brain Death/*diagnosis', 'Critical Care/*organization & administration', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/organization & administration', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Professional Competence', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Tissue Donors/classification', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/ethics/*methods', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*organization & administration', 'Withholding Treatment/ethics/*standards'];;;;10.1007/s00134-010-1848-y

126;20231566;Article;2010;Annals of internal medicine;;Regulated payments for living kidney donation: an empirical assessment of the ethical concerns.;;"BACKGROUND: Although regulated payments to encourage living kidney donation could reduce morbidity and mortality among patients waiting for a kidney transplant, doing so raises several ethical concerns. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which the 3 main concerns with paying kidney donors might manifest if a regulated market were created. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of participants' willingness to donate a kidney in 12 scenarios. SETTING: Regional rail and urban trolley lines in Philadelphia County, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: Of 550 potential participants, 409 completed the questionnaire (response rate, 74.4%); 342 of these participants were medically eligible to donate. INTERVENTION: Across scenarios, researchers experimentally manipulated the amount of money that participants would receive, the participants' risk for subsequently developing kidney failure themselves, and who would receive the donated kidney. MEASUREMENTS: The researchers determined whether payment represents an undue inducement by evaluating participants' sensitivity to risk in relation to the payment offered or an unjust inducement by evaluating participants' sensitivity to payment as a function of their annual income. The researchers also evaluated whether introducing payment would hinder altruistic donations by comparing participants' willingness to donate altruistically before versus after the introduction of payments. RESULTS: Generalized estimating equation models revealed that participants' willingness to donate increased significantly as their risk for kidney failure decreased, as the payment offered increased, and when the kidney recipient was a family member rather than a patient on a public waiting list (P < 0.001 for each). No statistical interactions were identified between payment and risk (odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.03]) or between payment and income (odds ratio, 1.01 [CI, 0.99 to 1.03]). The proximity of these  estimates to 1.0 and narrowness of the CIs suggest that payment is neither an undue nor an unjust inducement, respectively. Alerting participants to the possibility of payment did not alter their willingness to donate for altruistic reasons (P = 0.40).

In hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from unrelated donors and in the setting of solid organ transplantation from living donors, the standard of care is for donors and recipients to be managed by separate physicians to provide unbiased care. However, the practice patterns of evaluation and care of related donors and recipients are not well described. A survey of HCT centers in the United States was conducted by the Donor Health and  Safety Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research to determine the type of provider involved in medical clearance, informed consent, and medical management of hematopoietic cell collection and the relationship of that provider to the HC transplant recipient.  The response rate was 40%. In greater than 70% of centers, transplantation physicians were involved or potentially involved in overlapping care of the HC transplant donor and the recipient. These patterns were similar between transplantation teams caring for adult or pediatric donors and recipients. Among  responding centers, medical management of recipients and their related donors by  the same provider is common, a practice that has the potential for conflict of interest.;;O'Donnell PV, Pedersen TL, Confer DL, Rizzo JD, Pulsipher MA, Stroncek D, Leitman S, Anderlini P;;eng;"['Adult', 'Child', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Donor Selection/standards', 'Family', '*Health Care Surveys', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*standards', 'Hospital Bed Capacity', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/standards', 'Living Donors', 'Physician Executives', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards"", 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'United States']";;;5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1182/blood-2010-01-262915

While there are many examples citing the benefits this right provides for the individual, the impact that personal healthcare decisions have on others is often neglected. Here, evidence from end-stage renal disease is reviewed to hypothesise the creation of a universal kidney donation programme that although provides unparalleled benefits to its citizens, relies on the participation of a large proportion of the society. Given that this essay also addresses the public's major concerns regarding kidney donation, one of the only remaining implementation barriers is the individuals' right not to participate. Therefore,  irrespective of the humane and complex emotionally laden reasons for not enrolling in such programmes, this essay provides some estimates of the significant resource and quality of life costs associated with autonomy. Assuming humans are competent to make informed personal healthcare choices, similar to recent efforts to increase awareness about the negative impact of certain lifestyle choices on global warming, citizens should also be better informed about the medical costs their autonomy has on society.;;Diamandis P;;eng;['Humans', 'Informed Consent/psychology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Patient Rights/ethics', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Program Development', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration/standards'];;;Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada;10.1136/jme.2009.034306
133;20211992;Article;2010;Journal of medical ethics;;Understanding risk in living donor nephrectomy.;;OBJECTIVES: To investigate risk perception relating to living kidney donation, to compare the risk donors would accept with current practice and identify influential factors. DESIGN: An observational study consisting of questionnaires  completed by previous living donors and the general public. Participants selected the risk they would accept from a list of options, in various scenarios. Risk communication was investigated by randomly dividing the sample and presenting risk differently. SETTING: Primary care (two centres) and secondary care (one centre), London. PARTICIPANTS: 175 questionnaires were sent to patients who had previously undergone living-donor nephrectomy and to members of the public consulting a general practitioner. The living-donor sample comprised 77 consecutive donors at Guy's Hospital from May 2003 to January 2005. The general-public sample was recruited from two London healthcare centres. Of the eventual 151 participants, 61 were living donors and 90 were from the general public. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The amount of risk a participant would accept to donate a kidney. RESULTS: 74% of participants were willing to accept a risk of death higher than 1/3000. The most commonly accepted risk was 1/2 (29%). Those presented with a 'chance of survival' accepted higher risks than those presented  with a 'risk of death' (p<0.01). Greater risks were accepted when the recipient was closely related and, for some, when the recipient's prognosis was worse. No difference was observed between the living-donor and general-public groups. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney donors will accept a higher risk of death than is currently quoted, especially if risks are presented in terms of chance of survival.;;Maple NH, Hadjianastassiou V, Jones R, Mamode N;;eng;['Adult', 'Attitude to Death', 'Family', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrectomy/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration'];;;;10.1136/jme.2009.031740

METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was utilized to understand and quantify the preferences of 351 Canadian patients and  healthcare providers in relation to ethically challenging aspects of the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD): procurement and allocation of organs  for transplantation, end-of-life care discussions and decision making and the identities of those providing primary care. RESULTS: Patients and health professionals had clear preferences for detailed prognostic information, early advance care planning, shared end-of-life decision making, coordinated models of  care that enhance interaction and communication between primary and tertiary care and a more utilitarian approach of best match over first come, first served for allocating deceased donor kidneys. These data also suggest that the innovative strategies of non-directed anonymous donation and paired kidney exchange that are slowly being implemented internationally will be acceptable to both patients and  healthcare providers.

135;20203162;Article;2010;Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN;;Kidney transplantation and HIV: does recipient privacy outweigh the donor's right to information?;;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There exists an inherent conflict between a kidney donor's right to know key aspects of a recipient's medical history and specific disease, such as HIV, where federal and state statues protect this information. The authors of the live organ donor consensus group expressly stated the principal of a donor's right to recipient information. This information includes  the risks and benefits of not only the donation procedure, but also the risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options of the recipient. In this paper, a case will be presented highlighting this conflict and the ethical and legal reasoning used to resolve it. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A 22-year-old woman came forward as a directed kidney donor for an HIV-positive individual. The donor and recipient were medically appropriate for kidney donation and transplantation. During the donor advocacy panel review, there was disagreement regarding whether or not the potential donor had the right to know about the HIV status of the potential recipient. RESULTS: In living kidney transplantation to HIV-positive individuals, the recipient's right to privacy of  information outweighs the donor's right to know. CONCLUSIONS: Although protecting the recipient's right to privacy is paramount, the donor is still entitled to consider factors a priori that could alter their decision to donate. This can be  accomplished by informing the donor that they are not entitled to protected health information of the recipient and that their decision to donate should be based on knowing the recipient is medically appropriate for kidney transplantation.;;Formica RN Jr, Asch WS, Wagner KR, Kulkarni S;;eng;['Confidentiality/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Directed Tissue Donation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Female', 'Government Regulation', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Truth Disclosure/*ethics', 'United States', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.2215/CJN.06820909

Physician members of the American Society of Transplantation, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease were surveyed regarding organ markets for both living kidney and living liver transplantation. The survey queried respondents about their attitudes toward directed living donation, nondirected living donation, the potential legalization of living donor organ markets and the reasons for their support or opposition to organ markets. Partial or completed surveys were returned by 346 of 697 eligible respondents (50%). While virtually all supported or strongly supported directed living donation (98% and 95% for kidney and liver lobes, respectively), the vast majority disagreed or strongly disagreed with the legalization of living donor organ markets (80% for kidneys and 90% for liver lobes).

139;20189279;Article;2010;American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation;;Multiple listing in kidney transplantation.;;The increasing number of patients with end-stage renal disease and the expanding  waiting lists for various solid-organ transplants, particularly kidney transplants, has compelled prospective transplant recipients and their care teams to explore novel ways to accelerate this process, initiating the practice of multiple listing. Multiple listing is defined as being listed for an organ transplant at more than 1 transplant center. Current policy allows patients to be listed at more than 1 transplant center in 1 or more organ procurement organization. Multiple listing can be beneficial for different groups of transplant candidates. Current data support a beneficial effect for the patient on multiple waiting lists, most notably portending a survival advantage for transplant recipients. The kidney transplant list has the most patients who are multiply listed (4.7%), followed by the liver transplant list at 3.8%. The main potential downside of multiple listing is its effect on patients not on multiple  lists, as well as the cost accrued to achieve multiple listings. With the newly clarified policy of the United Network for Organ Sharing, a pivotal role for nephrologists in educating patients about the option of multiple listing becomes  more apparent. In this article, current practices and policies regarding multiple listing are reviewed and opinions and ethics relating to the practice are discussed.;;Sanaei Ardekani M, Orlowski JM;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/methods', '*Waiting Lists', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1053/j.ajkd.2009.11.022

Donation after cardiac death is one of the strategies they have been implemented in order to face organ shortage. Donation after cardiac death is internationally considered to be an encouraging source of organs for transplantation both because of its capacity to significantly increase the donor  pool and because of the quality of the organs obtained from non-heart-beating organ donors. These protocols give rise to important ethical issues that have been widely discussed in the international literature. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss the ethical issues that these protocols raise in these three countries.;;Tortosa JC, Rodriguez-Arias Vailhen D, Moutel G;;fre;['Advance Care Planning', 'Brain Death/diagnosis', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', '*Death', 'France', 'Heart Arrest', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Organ Preservation', 'Spain', 'Third-Party Consent/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];;;;10.1051/medsci/2010262209

The extent to which choice is present in parental living kidney donation has, however, been questioned. Since parents can be expected to have strong emotional bonds to their children, it has been asked whether these bonds make parents unable to say no to this donation. This article combines a narrative analysis of parents' stories of living kidney donation with a philosophical discussion of conditions for parental decision-making. Previous research has shown that parents often conclude that it  is ""natural"" to donate. Our study shows that this naturalness needs to be understood as part of a story where parental living kidney donation is regarded as natural and as a matter of non-choice. Our study also highlights the presence  of a parenthood moral imperative of always putting one's child's needs before one's own. On the basis of these results, we discuss conditions for decision-making in the context of parental LKD. We argue that the presence of a parenthood moral imperative can matter with regard to the decision-making process when parents consider whether to volunteer as living kidney donors, but that it need not hamper choice. We emphasise the need for exploring relational and situational factors in order to understand parental decision-making in the context of parental LKD.";;Zeiler K, Guntram L, Lennerling A;;eng;['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/ethics/*psychology', 'Male', '*Moral Obligations', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/*psychology'];;;;10.1007/s11019-010-9238-3

However, a significant amount of unrest in both the philosophical and the medical literature has surfaced since this practice began forty years ago. I argue that, first, declaring death by neurological criteria is both unreliable and unjustified but further, the ethical principles which themselves justify the dead donor rule are better served by abandoning that rule and instead allowing individuals who have suffered severe and irreversible brain damage to become organ donors, even though they are not yet dead and even though the removal of their organs would be the proximal cause  of death.;;Collins M;;eng;['*Attitude to Death', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/diagnosis', '*Brain Death/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Coma/diagnosis', '*Human Rights', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];;;;10.1093/jmp/jhq009

The study aimed to asses public opinions expressed in the Romanian media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Internet search was made. The pro and con reasons, the affiliation of parts involved in the debate and suggested future direction of action were identified. RESULTS: The Internet search had 8572 results. The parts involved in the pro and con debate consisted of governmental structures, physicians, ethicists, politicians, media, religious  authorities, nongovernmental associations, and lay persons. The main pros were the low rate of organ donation and the long waiting lists, enhancement of organ procurement, avoidance of wasting valuable organs, avoiding responsibility, and the stress imposed to the family in giving the donation consent, humanitarian purposes (saving lives), going along with the scientific progress, and less bureaucracy. The main cons were an unethical issue, violation of human rights, denial of brain death, unethical advantage of public ignorance, unethical use of  underprivileged people, little results in terms of organ procurement, but huge negative effects on public opinion, public mistrust in transplant programs and impossibility of refusal identification due to particularities of the Romanian medical system. CONCLUSION: The con opinions prevailed. For the moment, Romania seems to be unprepared to accept presumed consent.

This article reviews the outcome data for transplanted smokers, the rate of maintained abstinence from cigarettes by smokers who have quit and the ethics of using tobacco use as a transplant selection criterion. RECENT FINDINGS: Consistent with earlier studies, recently published articles continue to demonstrate an increased risk of noncutaneous malignancies, higher rates of graft arterial thrombosis and a higher mortality rate in liver transplant patients who smoke as compared with nonsmokers. There is a significant rate of relapse to smoking after transplantation, and the rates are higher among patients with alcoholic liver disease. Recent studies have shown that 10-16% of patients with biochemical verification of active smoking deny their tobacco use when interviewed for transplant consideration. Although extensively, if not universally, used to exclude transplant candidates, a recent  study of marijuana use showed no difference in mortality outcomes as compared with nonusers.

However, buying and selling organs faces widespread disapproval. We survey a representative sample of Americans to assess disapproval for several forms of kidney market, and to understand why individuals disapprove by identifying factors that predict disapproval, including disapproval of markets for other body parts, dislike of increased scope for markets and distrust of markets generally. Our results suggest that while the public is potentially receptive to compensating kidney donors, among those who oppose it, general disapproval toward certain kinds of transactions is at least as important as concern about specific policy details.

154;20132167;Article;2010;American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons;;What the medical excuse teaches us about the potential living donor as patient.;;Since the inception of living donor kidney transplantation, physicians have expressed concern about the voluntariness of the donors and their ability to recuse themselves. The literature from the late 1960s and early 1970s reveals the practice of offering a false medical excuse, although more recent comments seem to focus more on a 'general statement of lack of suitability' or 'a blameless explanation'. Simmerling et al. argue that the provision of a medical excuse rests on deception, which is wrong on deontological grounds (that physicians should hold to a principle of veracity) and on consequential grounds (deception threatens to damage trust and the doctor-patient relationship and deception may have adverse impact on the donor's relationship with his family). In this paper I examine and reject these objections. I argue that a false medical excuse is morally unjustifiable, but the medical excuse understood as a 'general statement  of lack of suitability' is morally permissible because it promotes donor autonomy (the donor's right to decide whether or not to donate), and protects and preserves the donor's rights to privacy and confidentiality (by affirming the donor as an independent patient).;;Ross LF;;eng;['Coercion', 'Confidentiality', '*Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Privacy'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.03010.x

Nevertheless, the extreme shortage of transplant organs in the U.S. continues to make organ transplantation in China an appealing option for some patients with end-stage disease.

By discussing two cases that raised this dilemma, we argue for upholding medicine's commitments to traditional principles of beneficence and nonjudgmental regard in sorting out the policies that a transplant program should adopt.

165;20130495;Article;2010;Transplantation;;Controlled organ donation after cardiac death: potential donors in the emergency  department.;;"BACKGROUND.: The continuing shortfall of organs for transplantation has increased the use of donation after cardiac death (DCD). We hypothesized that some patients who undergo tracheal intubation in the emergency department (ED) and who are assessed for, but not admitted to, critical care might have potential for controlled DCD. METHODS.: We identified all patients who underwent tracheal intubation in the ED between 2004 and 2008 and studied their records to identify  those not admitted to an intensive care unit. We reviewed the notes of patients extubated in the ED to ascertain the diagnosis, management, outcome, and potential exclusion criteria for controlled DCD. RESULTS.: One thousand three hundred seventy-four patients had tracheal intubation performed in the ED; 1053 received anesthetic drugs to assist intubation. Three hundred seventy-five patients were not admitted to intensive care unit; 235 died during resuscitation  in the ED. Of the 49 patients extubated in the ED to allow terminal care, 26 were older than 70 years and 18 had comorbidities precluding organ donation. Fourteen  patients could have been considered for DCD, but in eight, the time from extubation to death exceeded 2 hr. Thus, six patients might have been missed as potential controlled DCD from the ED in this 5-year period. CONCLUSIONS.: Identification of potential donors after cardiac death in the ED with appropriate use of critical care for selected patients may contribute to reducing the shortfall of organs for transplantation, although numbers are likely to be small. This area remains controversial and requires further informed discussion between  emergency and critical care doctors and transplant teams.";;Blackstock M, McKeown DW, Ray DC;;eng;['*Death', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Intubation, Intratracheal/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Scotland', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*statistics & numerical data', 'Urban Population'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e3181d2bff4

RECENT FINDINGS: Living donors have become an increasingly important source of organs for transplantation. Concern for the rights of donors has resulted in reconsideration of the use of minors as living organ donors. Most commentators have voiced concerns that minors deserve extraordinary protection, but are unwilling to ban the practice of living donation by minors outright. Instead, factors to be considered in individual situations have been enumerated, and safeguards recommended. These same safeguards have also been recommended to be extended to adults, as attainment of  legal age does not in itself confer immunity from exploitation. Developmental factors of importance include brain maturation affecting decision making, executive function and impulse control; the dependent status of minors, usually on the persons who may most want them to be donors; youthful idealism and sense of invulnerability; and incomplete identity formation. SUMMARY: Fewer children in the USA have become living donors in the past decade. Preadolescent children in particular should probably be considered as potential donors only in extraordinary circumstances. Safeguards protect not only children, but transplant physicians, programs and the image of the transplant endeavor.";;Olbrisch ME, Levenson JL, Newman JD;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Altruism', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Child', '*Child Advocacy/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Comprehension', 'Gift Giving', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Living Donors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology/*supply & distribution', '*Minors/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Psychology, Adolescent', 'Psychology, Child', 'Public Opinion', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0b013e328337352a
167;20124892;Article;2010;Critical care medicine;;The circulatory-respiratory determination of death in organ donation.;;"OBJECTIVE: Death statutes permit physicians to declare death on the basis of irreversible cessation of circulatory-respiratory or brain functions. The growing practice of organ donation after circulatory determination of death now requires  physicians to exercise greater specificity in circulatory-respiratory death determination. We studied circulatory-respiratory death determination to clarify  its concept, practice, and application to innovative circulatory determination of death protocols. RESULTS: It is ethically and legally appropriate to procure organs when permanent cessation (will not return) of circulation and respiration  has occurred but before irreversible cessation (cannot return) has occurred because permanent cessation: 1) is an established medical practice standard for determining death; 2) is the meaning of ""irreversible"" in the Uniform Determination of Death Act; and 3) does not violate the ""Dead Donor Rule."" CONCLUSIONS: The use of unmodified extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the circulatory determination of death donor after death is declared should be abandoned because, by restoring brain circulation, it retroactively negates the previous death determination. Modifications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation that avoid this problem by excluding brain circulation are contrived, invasive, and, if used, should require consent of surrogates. Heart donation in circulatory determination of death is acceptable if proper standards are followed to declare donor death after establishing the permanent cessation of circulation. Pending additional data on ""auto-resuscitation,"" we recommend that all circulatory determination of death programs should utilize the prevailing standard of 2 to 5 mins of demonstrated mechanical asystole before declaring death.";;Bernat JL, Capron AM, Bleck TP, Blosser S, Bratton SL, Childress JF, DeVita MA, Fulda GJ, Gries CJ, Mathur M, Nakagawa TA, Rushton CH, Shemie SD, White DB;;eng;['Brain Death/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Death', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Heart Arrest/*diagnosis', 'Heart Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c58916

Despite evidence that a substantial number of families who agree to multiorgan donation also specifically refuse corneal donation, it is unclear why this occurs and what can be done to increase rates of corneal donation. We conducted a survey of 371 Australian adults regarding their views on corneal donation. Although willingness to donate corneas generally reflected a person's willingness to donate all of one's organs, unwillingness to donate corneas appeared to be due to other factors. Specifically, decisions not to donate appear to be driven by a range of  concerns surrounding disfigurement. The survey also provides eye banks with reassurance about the acceptability of whole globe procurement, and recognition that research into blindness is a highly valued part of corneal donation. Finally, the survey identifies that many individuals see benefit in having their  family engaged in the decision-making process, suggesting that decisions about donation are more complex than a simple appeal to the autonomy of the deceased.;;Lawlor M, Kerridge I, Ankeny R, Dobbins TA, Billson F;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude', 'Australia', 'Cornea/*pathology', 'Corneal Transplantation/*methods', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors/psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02986.x

The following guidelines were chosen for evaluation: ""Care of patients in the end of life"", ""Palliative care"", ""Borderline questions in intensive-care medicine"" and ""The determination of death in the context of organ transplantation"". METHODS: Anonymous questionnaires were sent to 1933 physicians (general practitioners and  internists) and nurses, randomly chosen from address lists of the relevant professional associations. We conducted a statistical analysis using SPSS 16.0. RESULTS: The response rate was 43.1%. 16.3% of the responding physicians had never heard of the guidelines ""Care of patients in the end of life"", 30.5% had already heard of them, 34.1% knew some of their contents and 19.1% were familiar  with the complete content of the guidelines. 60.5% of those physicians and 56.0%  of those nurses who had at least heard of these guidelines utilised them in clinical practice. The guidelines ""Palliative care"" and ""Borderline questions in  intensive-care medicine"" yielded similar results. By contrast, only 0.5% of responding physicians reported never having heard of the guidelines ""The determination of death in the context of organ transplantation"", 2.9% had already heard of them, 24.4% knew some of their contents and the vast majority of respondents (72.2%) considered themselves to be completely familiar with the guidelines. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the evaluated guidelines is fairly widespread among Swiss GPs, internists and nurses. The guidelines are utilised in clinical practice by the majority of those care providers who are aware of their  existence.

To date, even the most  comprehensive models have been unable to adequately explain these racial disparities, leaving policymakers unsure how best to intervene. Previous individual-level analyses, which have implicated risk factors such as race, financial status, cultural beliefs, unemployment, lack of commitment to surgery and lack of continuous access to care, overlook contextual and social network exposures. Social networks present a compelling way to examine cumulative risk clustered across individuals. Social networks have been shown to influence health outcomes and health behaviors through various pathways, including shared social capital, engaging in similar or group risky behaviors, diffusion of information and adopting or propagating social norms. Precursors to chronic kidney disease, including obesity, have been shown to spread through social networks. Social network analysis can reveal shared risks between potential donors and recipients  in a given network, clarifying the likelihood of finding an appropriate match through either direct donation or paired exchanges. This paper presents a novel application of social network analysis to transplantation, illustrating implications for disparities and future clinical interventions.;;Ladin K, Hanto DW;;eng;['Ethnic Groups', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Promotion', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/etiology', 'Living Donors', 'Obesity/complications', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/*methods', 'Social Class', 'Social Support', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2009.02963.x

As a partial solution to this disparity, living unrelated transplantation is being performed more frequently, and some have proposed providing financial incentives to donors.

The current paper will also examine the viewpoint that medical ethics is not separable from the prevailing needs of society and involves a constant balancing of often opposing goods. Issues surrounding living unrelated donor transplantation illustrate ethics as a dynamically evolving field, which is often influenced by necessity and which evolves with progression of science and society.

Government efforts, supported by professional associations, civil society organizations and the media, along with World Health Organization technical assistance, have led to the development of legislation regulating this  practice and curbing organ trade in conformity with international guidelines. Although only two years have passed since the enactment of the law, there is evidence that conditions have significantly improved, raising hopes for ethical and safe organ transplantation in Pakistan.

187;19957020;Article;2010;European journal of epidemiology;;Changing defaults in biobank research could save lives too.;;In an effort to increase the amount of organs available for transplantation, many countries have implemented presumed consent for organ donation. Presuming a wish  to contribute to medical advances through biobank research on previously taken tissue samples could similarly improve health and wellbeing. In this article we analyze common arguments for and against presumed consent for organ donation and  assess their relevance in the context of biobank research. In spite of obvious differences between biobank research and organ transplantation the cases for implementing presumption of a positive attitude appear quite analogous. It has repeatedly been shown that a majority of the general population supports these projects and selecting informed consent as the default position decreases the amount of organs and samples available and thus reduces the prospect of promoting health. We conclude that instead of presuming that individuals do not wish to contribute to the advancement of healthcare through biobank research on previously taken samples, ethics committees should presume that they do.;;Forsberg JS, Eriksson S, Hansson MG;;eng;['Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Presumed Consent/*ethics', 'Research', 'Tissue Banks/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1007/s10654-009-9413-0

METHODS: Following approval of the local ethics committee, 20 renal allograft recipients were included in this study. ASL perfusion measurement and an anatomical T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo (HASTE) sequence were performed on a 1.5-T scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). T2-weighted MR urography was performed in patients with suspected ureteral obstruction. Patients were assigned to three groups: group a,  6 patients with stable allograft function over the previous 4 months; group b, 7  patients with good allograft function who underwent transplantation during the previous 3 weeks; group c, 7 allograft recipients with an acute deterioration of  renal function. RESULTS: Mean cortical perfusion values were 304.8 +/- 34.4, 296.5 +/- 44.1, and 181.9 +/- 53.4 mg/100 ml/min for groups a, b and c, respectively. Reduction in cortical perfusion in group c was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ASL is a promising technique for nonenhanced quantification of cortical perfusion of renal allografts.

190;19931963;Article;2010;Social science & medicine (1982);;Perceptions of the gift relationship in organ and tissue donation: Views of intensivists and donor and recipient coordinators.;;"The international literature on organ donation and transplantation has drawn attention to the popularity of ""gift of life"" discourse among pro-donation advocates, transplantation specialists, and within organisations lobbying for improved donation rates to promote the benefits of organ donation among members of the general public. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, gift of life discourse is robust. Aside from attempts to elicit altruism by promoting tissue donation in the public domain, gift terminology separates the act of donation from that of commerce and  the commodification of body tissues. In distancing donation from commodification  and the potential to degrade and exploit human beings, it is assumed that gift discourse transmits the positive message that donation is a noble and morally worthy act. Recent sociological research has shown that assumptions of the gift as one-way and altruistic do not necessarily align with people's perceptions and  experience of donating body tissues, and that the vocabulary used to describe these acts is often at variance with reality. This article draws on interview data with 15 critical care specialists (intensivists) and donor and recipient coordinators, examining their perceptions of the relevance of gift discourse and  its applicability in the context of deceased donation in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The data indicate several problems with gift rhetoric to describe the situations  health professionals encounter. In sum, gift terminology tends to downplay the sacrifice involved in tissue donation generally, as well as depoliticising the exchange relations of tissue transfer in contemporary consumer culture and in the global context. This raises questions about the underlying ethics of language choice and what, if anything, empirical accounts of tissue transfer can contribute to ethical debates.";;Shaw R;;eng;['Altruism', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Critical Care', '*Gift Giving', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'New Zealand', 'Persuasive Communication', '*Terminology as Topic', 'Third-Party Consent', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/organization & administration'];;;;10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.10.062

We suggest that good donor  risk communication in families promote ""conscientious autonomy"" and ""reflective trust"".

DCD is defined as organ donation once death is  declared after irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, as opposed to brain death (donation after neurological death). Though DCD is one  of the fastest growing categories of organ donors, it comprises only 8% of all deceased donors (Steinbrook in N Engl J Med 357:209-213, 2007). Prior to 1968, when the Ad Hoc Committee of Harvard Medical School proposed a neurological definition of death based on brain-death criteria, organs from deceased donors came from patients who had suffered cardio-pulmonary demise (IOM, Non-heart-beating organ transplantation: practice and protocols, 2000). Early transplantation from DCD donors met with limited success and most transplant surgeons turned to brain-dead donors. Consequently, DCD fell out of vogue and, until recently, has not been the focus of transplant initiatives.";;Frontera JA;;eng;['Adult', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Critical Care/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Health Policy/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Heart Arrest/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations', 'Life Support Care/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Male', 'Morphine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Narcotics/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, U.S., Health and Medicine Division', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States', 'Withholding Treatment/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1007/s12028-009-9294-9

The purpose of this study was to report the Dutch experience of kidney transplantation using pediatric donation after cardiac death. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of a series of consecutive kidney transplantations from pediatric donation after cardiac death from January 1995 to July 2006. SETTING: Kidneys were procured in seven Dutch procurement areas. PATIENTS: Recipients of kidneys from donors after cardiac death aged 2 to 17 yrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prospectively collected data from the Dutch Organ  Transplant Registry were analyzed. Donor, graft, and recipient characteristics of all pediatric donations after cardiac death kidney transplantations were documented. Recipients were followed-up for glomerular filtration rate, graft, and patient survival. Eighty-eight patients were transplanted with 90 pediatric donation-after-cardiac-death kidneys, which was 31% of the total number of transplanted pediatric donor kidneys. In 77% of recipients, organs were procured  from controlled donors, after withdrawal of supportive treatment. Of all donors,  9% were younger than age 6 yrs. Two patients received their graft preemptively. In the others, the incidence of immediate function, delayed graft function, and primary nonfunction were 49%, 44%, and 7%, respectively. Warm ischemia time > or  =25 mins was associated with primary nonfunction. Overall graft and patient survival 5 yrs after transplantation were 80% and 88%, respectively.

The answer I  defend in this paper is that the more undesirable the consequences of making a mistake in accepting a scientific hypothesis, the higher the degree of confirmation required for its acceptance. I argue that the application of this principle should lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that 'less than perfect' Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) matches are an important determinant of kidney graft survival. The scientific community has been divided all along on the significance of partial antigen matches. Yet reliance on partial matches has emerged as one of the primary factors leading blacks to spend a much longer time  than whites on the waiting list for kidneys, thereby potentially impacting the justice of the kidney allocation policy.

However, the treatment's accessibility is limited by a chronic shortage of transplantable kidneys, resulting in the death of numerous patients worldwide as they wait for a kidney to become available. Despite the implementation of various measures the disparity between supply and needs continues to grow. This paper begins with a look at the current treatment options, including various sources of transplantable kidneys, for end-stage renal disease. We propose, in accordance with others, the introduction of compensated kidney donation as a means of addressing the current shortage. We briefly outline some of the advantages of this proposal, and then turn to examine several of the  ethical arguments usually marshaled against it in a bid to demonstrate that this  proposal indeed passes the ethics test. Using available data of public opinions on compensated donation, we illustrate that public support for such a program would be adequate enough that we can realistically eliminate the transplant waiting list if compensation is introduced.

This paper defends the importance of a more systematic conception of responsibility to improve moral philosophical as well as descriptive analysis. METHODS: We start with a formal analysis of the relational conception of responsibility and its meta-ethical presuppositions. In a brief historical overview, we compare global-collective, professional, personal, and social responsibility. The value of our analytical matrix is illustrated by sorting out the plurality of responsibility models in three cases (organ transplantation, advance directives, and genetic testing). RESULTS: Responsibility is a relational term involving at least seven relata. The analysis of the relata allows distinguishing between individual versus collective agency, retrospective versus prospective direction, and liability versus power relations. Various bioethical ambiguities result from insufficient, implicit, or  inappropriate ascriptions of responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic conception of responsibility is an important tool for bioethical reflection. It allows an in-depth understanding and critique of moral claims on a meta-ethical level without presuming one particular normative approach. Considering the concept of responsibility can also help to complement the current bioethical focus on individual autonomy by including the perspectives of other actors, such as family members or social groups.";;Schicktanz S, Schweda M;;eng;;;;;10.1007/s12376-011-0070-8

Thorough psychosocial evaluation is necessary to minimize those risks, yet little has been written about the donor assessment process. This article describes one such process, utilized by a transplant program in upstate New York. METHOD: Donor candidates undergo multiple psychosocial interviews early in the overall transplant evaluation process. Evaluators subsequently meet as a group, along with an independent ethicist, to determine psychosocial candidacy prior to final  medical/surgical clearance. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2007, 416 donor candidates  initiated and/or underwent full evaluation, resulting in a 17.5% surgery and 55.5% exclusion rate among those individuals. Of those ruled out, 20.8% were for  (medical or psychosocial) reasons associated with the recipient, and 8.7% were for donor-related psychosocial issues.

200;22197975;Article;2012;Brain : a journal of neurology;;The transatlantic divide over brain death determination and the debate.;;In 1976, the Royal College of Physicians published neurological criteria of death. The memorandum stated that-after preconditions and exclusion criteria were met-the absence of brainstem function, including apnoea testing, would suffice. In the USA, many experts felt that brain death could be only determined by demonstrating death of the entire brain. In the history of further refinement of  UK and USA brain death criteria, one particular period stands out that would bring about an apparent transatlantic divide. On 13 October 1980, the British Broadcasting Corporation aired a programme entitled 'Transplants: Are the Donors  Really Dead?' Several United States experts not only disagreed with the United Kingdom criteria, but claimed that patients diagnosed with brain death using United Kingdom criteria could recover. The fallout of this television programme was substantial, as indicated by a media frenzy and a 6-month period of heated correspondence within The Lancet and The British Medical Journal. Members of the  Parliament questioned the potential long-term effect on the public's trust in organ transplantation. Given the concerns raised, the British Broadcasting Corporation commissioned a second programme, which was broadcast on 19 February 1981 entitled 'A Question of Life or Death: The Brain Death Debate.' Two panels debated the issues on the accuracy of the electroencephalogram and its place, the absolute need for assessing preconditions before an examination, the problems with recognition of toxins and the feasibility of doing a new prospective study in the United Kingdom, which would follow patients' examination assessed with United Kingdom criteria until cardiac standstill. The positions of the United States and United Kingdom remained diametrically opposed to each other. This article revisits this landmark moment and places it in a wider historical context. In the USA, the focus was not on the brainstem, and the definition of brain death became rapidly infused with terms such as whole brain death (all intracranial structures above the foramen magnum), cerebral death (all supratentorial structures) or higher brain death (cortical structures) virtually  synonymous with persistent vegetative state. This review also identifies the fortitude of neurosurgeon Bryan Jennett and neurologist Christopher Pallis by introducing new corroborative data on the diagnosis of brain death and clarifying the United Kingdom position. Both understood that brainstem death was the infratentorial consequence of a supratentorial catastrophe. With the 1995 American Academy of Neurology practice parameters, the differences between the UK and USA brain death determination would become much less apparent.;;Wijdicks EF;;eng;['Brain Death/*diagnosis', 'Ethics, Medical/history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Mass Media/history', 'Persistent Vegetative State', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/history', '*Transplantation/ethics/history', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];;;;10.1093/brain/awr282
201;22161820;Article;2011;Swiss medical weekly;;Financial incentives to improve organ donation: what is the opinion of the Vaud French-speaking population?;;BACKGROUND: With the increase of the organ shortage, several authors assume that  financial incentives would improve organ donation rates and fill the unbalance between the demand and the organs available for transplant medicine. This line of argument has been criticised with people arguing that an exchange of money for organs would violate the legal and the ethical principle of gratuity, decrease voluntarism and increase the body parts commodification phenomena. PURPOSE: Switzerland is often highlighted as having under-average organ donation rates compared to other European countries. In this paper we investigate the opinions of the Vaud French-speaking population concerning direct, indirect and non financial incentives in order to assess their opinions and anticipate the further debate. METHODS: As part of a broad survey about the organ donation decision-making process, questions about incentives for both living and deceased  organ donation were addressed to Vaud inhabitants and physicians. RESULTS: The data collected showed that respondents were opposed to rewarding both living and  deceased organ donation. The analysis of positive answers showed that indirect and non financial incentives were the most likely choice to acknowledge the donor's act. People in critical financial situations preferred direct financial incentives. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that altruism and gratuity were key-values in the organ donation and transplantation social perceptions of the respondents. Thus, we assume that introducing financial incentives could tarnish  the image of transplant medicine. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to evaluate if their introduction would improve the organ donation rates or decrease voluntarism.;;Bosisio F, Santiago M, Benaroyo L;;eng;['Adult', 'Altruism', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Motivation', 'Organ Transplantation/ethnology/*psychology', '*Public Opinion', 'Reward', 'Social Perception', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Switzerland', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/statistics & numerical data'];;;;10.4414/smw.2011.13312

Facial transplantation  has become a surgical option in clinical situations in which soft tissue and bone loss is accompanied by severe cosmetic, sensory, and functional deficiencies due  to disease, trauma, or congenital malformations. With the introduction of facial  tissue transplantation surgery came complex clinical, technological, and ethical  patient care issues. These complex issues included determining patient selection  criteria, refining donor tissue procurement techniques, predicting expected functional outcomes, appreciating the limitations of obtaining a fully informed consent for an innovative procedure, and deliberating the immunological response  and postoperative immunosuppressant requirements of the recipient. In addition, psychological implications for the patient, societal consequences, and ethical concerns have been discussed. The short-term results have been positive. Results  to date indicate that the clinical, technical, and immunological patient care issues in this emerging science appear to mirror those of other reconstructive and organ transplantation procedures.

Its Custodian Group has successfully led various countries to implement legislation against trafficking and commercialism. The question arises, however, whether efforts to prohibit organ trade are realistic and effective. The Declaration differentiates trafficking from commercialism, yet it does not mention how both acts should be approached by policy. Policies that address transplant commercialism work differently from policies that tackle organ trafficking. There is considerable room for improvement in the current prohibitive approach to commercialism and organ trafficking. The Custodian Group and World Health Organization (WHO) should address commercialism by encouraging the expansion of living donation in the same manner as they encourage deceased donation. Furthermore, the Custodian Group and  the WHO can improve their strategy to combat organ trafficking by raising awareness for enforcement. To achieve a consistent and effective prohibition of trafficking, legislation and law enforcement must go hand in hand.

Some juridical councils such as the Organization of Islamic Conferences' Islamic Fiqh Academy (OIC-IFA) equate brain death with cardiopulmonary death, while others such as the Islamic Organization of Medical Sciences (IOMS) analogize brain death to an intermediate state between life and death. Still other councils have repudiated the notion entirely. Similarly, the ethico-legal assessments are not uniform in their acceptance of brain-stem or whole-brain criteria for death, and consequently their conceptualizations of, brain death. Within the medical literature, and in the statements of Muslim medical professional societies, brain death has been viewed as sanctioned by Islamic law with experts citing the aforementioned rulings. Furthermore, health policies around organ transplantation and end-of-life care within the Muslim world have been crafted with consideration of these representative religious determinations made by transnational, legally-inclusive, and multidisciplinary councils. The determinations of these councils also have bearing upon Muslim clinicians and patients who encounter the  challenges of brain death at the bedside. For those searching for 'Islamically-sanctioned' responses that can inform their practice, both the OIC-IFA and IOMS verdicts have palpable gaps in their assessments and remain clinically ambiguous. In this paper we analyze these verdicts from the perspective of applied Islamic bioethics and raise several questions that, if answered by future juridical councils, will better meet the needs of clinicians and bioethicists.;;Padela AI, Arozullah A, Moosa E;;eng;['*Brain Death', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Human Rights', 'Humans', '*Islam', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Terminal Care/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];;;;10.1111/j.1467-8519.2011.01935.x
205;22143436;Article;2011;Transplantation;;Informed consent and decision-making about adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation: a systematic review of empirical research.;;Adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a complex procedure that poses serious health risks to and provides no direct health benefit for the  donor. Because of this uneven risk-benefit ratio, ensuring donor autonomy through informed consent is critical. To assess the current knowledge pertaining to informed consent for LDLT, we conducted a systematic review of the empirical literature on donors' decision-making process, comprehension about risks and outcomes, and information needs for LDLT. Of the 1423 identified articles, 24 met final review criteria, representing the perspective of approximately 2789 potential and actual donors. As donors' decisions to donate often occur before evaluation, they often make uninformed decisions. The review found that 88% to 95% of donors reported understanding information clinicians disclosed about risks and benefits. However, donors reported unmet information needs, knowledge gaps regarding risks, and unanticipated complications. Few donors reported feeling pressure to donate. Most studies were limited by cultural differences, small sample sizes, inconsistent measures, and poor methodological approaches. This systematic review suggests that informed consent for LDLT is sub-optimal as donors do not adequately appreciate disclosed information during the informed consent process, despite United Network for Organ Sharing/CMS regulations requiring formal psychological evaluation of donor candidates. Interventions are  needed to improve donor-clinician communication during the LDLT informed consent  process such as through the use of comprehension assessment tools and e-health educational tools that leverage adult learning theory to effectively convey LDLT  outcome data.;;Gordon EJ, Daud A, Caicedo JC, Cameron KA, Jay C, Fryer J, Beauvais N, Skaro A, Baker T;;eng;['Adult', 'Decision Making', 'Empirical Research', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent/psychology', '*Liver Transplantation/ethics/psychology', '*Living Donors/psychology', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Risk Assessment'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e31823817d5

212;22099831;Article;2011;Transplantation proceedings;;Hand transplantation: is it an ethical decision, a bioethical one, or both?;;Essays by Seigler and Emmanuel define some criteria and requirements when doing an innovative procedure such as hand transplantation to determine whether it is possible to conduct clinical research. These criteria and requirements take into  account the patient, the medical team, and society. However, we think that there  are still other considerations that have not been given sufficient emphasis to justify an innovative procedure and are mainly determined by the patient and his  environment, along with other quality-of-life issues, including social acceptance (according to cultural norms), appearance (body image), and function. There should be a balance between the patient, the medical team, and societal considerations in the decision process. Progressive societies are responsible for the distribution of the necessary resources to perform innovative procedures while controlling the costs of integral treatment and ensuring related investigations, thus facilitating the evaluation and advancement of innovative surgery. If these factors are taken into account along with the criteria already  outlined involving the patient's cultural dimensions and the involved costs a decision can be made whether to proceed with hand transplantation. Being a difficult complex decision, it is imperative that it be made not only by an individual or group, either the patient or the medical team (ethical decision), but in conjunction with public discussion (bioethical decision) that not only takes into account the risks, benefits, and costs, but by including all criteria  must also be at least technical, human, and social.;;Bermudez J, Latorre LF, Moreno C, DeBedout R;;eng;['*Bioethics', 'Biomedical Research/ethics', 'Decision Making', '*Hand Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Program Development', 'Risk', 'Transplantation/*ethics/*methods/trends'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.09.046

The aim of this study was to compare and analyze results for of the traditional method and a point-score system in the allocation of deceased patient's kidneys. METHODS: The 12 major kidney transplant centers in the country having a deceased-donor program were invited to participate. Only 3 of them replied to the invitation during 2010. A point-score system was proposed  to them, comprising blood group, waiting list time, HLA type, and donor and recipient ages. Once the final recipient was chosen, an explanation of reasons for the choice was requested. Thirty-eight transplants were presented. Kappa coefficient was used to measure degree of agreement in both allocation systems. Organs donated for transplantation came from patients between 4 and 54 years old, including 52% female, 52% O+ blood type, 31% A+, and 11% B+, 44% cranial-encephalic trauma, and 44% brain hemorrhage. RESULTS: Global agreement was 52.6% (kappa = 0.343), and partial agreement was 76.3% (weighted kappa = 0.204), assigning more intensity to extreme values, but with a lower correlation  index. A more intense agreement, without discriminating by hospital, was found for ""A"" category (blood group), followed by ""B"" category (waiting list time). DISCUSSION: Taking into consideration the determining factors for long-term graft survival, it is indispensable to include criteria such as donor and recipient ages and HLA typife in the allocation process. This first draft of a point-score  system in organ allocation included waiting list time, blood group, urgency related to vascular/peritoneal access for dialysis, clinical condition, donor/recipient age ratio, and HLA antigenic compatibility.";;Cantu-Quintanilla G, Alberu J, Reyes-Acevedo R, Medeiros M, Villa MS, Arreola JM, Gracida C, Reyes-Lopez A;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/mortality', 'Kidney Transplantation/*methods', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods/standards'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.09.091

However, the OPTN does not provide specific guidelines for what information should be disclosed to potential recipients. Such vagueness opens the door to inadequate informed consent. This paper examines the  ethical dimensions of informed consent when the prospective living donor has self-reported behaviors associated with increased risk for infection transmission. Donor privacy is a primary ethical concern that conflicts with recipients' informed consent for use of increased risk organs. We propose that both the increased risk status and the specific behavior be disclosed to the recipient. Because the actual risk posed is linked to the type of risk behavior,  disclosure is therefore needed to make an informed decision. The donor's risk behavior is material to recipients' decision making because it may impact the donor-recipient relationship. This relationship is the foundation of the donation and acceptance transaction, and thus comprises a critical feature of the recipient's informed consent. Optimizing a recipient's informed consent is essential to protecting patient safety and autonomy.";;Gordon EJ, Beauvais N, Theodoropoulos N, Hanneman J, McNatt G, Penrod D, Jensen S, Franklin J, Sherman L, Ison MG;;eng;['Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*ethics/*psychology', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2011.03814.x

This in part may relate to the failure of those involved in transplantation medicine and public education to fully appreciate the different meanings attached to the body of a recently deceased person. Medicine and science have long understood the body as a ""machine."" This view has fitted with medical notions of transplantation, with donors being a source of biologic ""goods."" However, even a cursory glance at the rituals surrounding death makes it apparent that there is more to a dead body than simply its biologic parts; in death, bodies continue as the physical substrate of relationships. Of all the organs, it is the eyes that are identified as the site of sentience, and there is a long tradition of visual primacy and visual symbolism in virtually all aspects of culture. It therefore seems likely that of all the body parts, it is the eyes that are most central to social relationships. A request to donate the eyes therefore is unlikely to be heard simply in medical terms as a request to donate  a ""superfluous"" body part for the benefit of another.

Taking up the idea of transplantation as a 'complex', a vast assemblage of people, places, practices and procedures which intersect medical, social and cultural domains, I point to a reliance in the anthropological literature on overly pre-determined conceptual frameworks, organised around a distinct polarisation between organ giving and receiving, where one side (supply) takes analytical, and indeed moral, precedence over the other (receipt). These frameworks tend to fail us when it comes to thinking about the wider social, cultural and political implications of transplant technologies. In an attempt to  offer a less polarised view, I draw attention to the material and symbolic role of the immune system in transplantation and the ways in which it simultaneously shapes opportunities for procurement and the lived realities of recipiency. This  helps us see the many complex ways in which suffering and inequality are constituted all along the variegated chains of supply and demand that are internal to, and made possible by, transplantation practices themselves.;;Kierans C;;eng;['Anthropology, Cultural', 'Anthropology, Medical/*ethics', 'Culture', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Family', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Immune System', 'Internationality', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/ethnology', 'Politics', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation/ethics'];;;;10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.008
234;21990949;Article;2011;World journal of gastroenterology;;Future of liver transplantation: non-human primates for patient-specific organs from induced pluripotent stem cells.;;Strategies to fill the huge gap in supply versus demand of human organs include bioartificial organs, growing humanized organs in animals, cell therapy, and implantable bioengineered constructs. Reproducing the complex relations between different cell types, generation of adequate vasculature, and immunological complications are road blocks in generation of bioengineered organs, while immunological complications limit the use of humanized organs produced in animals. Recent developments in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) biology offer a possibility of generating human, patient-specific organs in non-human primates (NHP) using patient-derived iPSC and NHP-derived iPSC lacking the critical developmental genes for the organ of interest complementing a NHP tetraploid embryo. The organ derived in this way will have the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) profile as the patient. This approach can be curative in  genetic disorders as this offers the possibility of gene manipulation and correction of the patient's genome at the iPSC stage before tetraploid complementation. The process of generation of patient-specific organs such as the liver in this way has the great advantage of making use of the natural signaling  cascades in the natural milieu probably resulting in organs of great quality for  transplantation. However, the inexorable scientific developments in this direction involve several social issues and hence we need to educate and prepare  society in advance to accept the revolutionary consequences, good, bad and ugly.;;Sanal MG;;eng;['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Liver Diseases/surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods', 'Organ Culture Techniques/ethics/methods', 'Pan troglodytes', '*Primates', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods'];['Anencephaly', 'Chimpanzee', 'Fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase deficient', 'Hepatocytes', 'Hhex', 'Induced pluripotent stem cells', 'Non-human primates', 'Tetraploid'];;;10.3748/wjg.v17.i32.3684

Unfortunately, while BMT generally provides the only possibility of cure for such afflicted children, few (25%) have a matched sibling available, and suitably matched unrelated donors are often not identified for many children in need of BMT. And even where BMT is possible, treatment is complex and arduous and associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The issues raised when either or both the donor and recipient are children and lack the capacity to make informed and rational decisions relating to BMT pose great challenges for all involved.

Assessment of liver transplant candidates with psychiatric illnesses.;;Allocating scarce organs to transplant candidates is only one stage in the long process of organ transplantation. Before being listed, all candidates must undergo a rigorous assessment by a multidisciplinary transplant team. The Department of Health and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) are responsible for the development of detailed strategies to ensure a fair and objective assessment experience for all transplant candidates. Difficulties arise when particularly vulnerable candidates, such as candidates with psychiatric illnesses, are assessed. NHSBT has already developed unique assessment guidelines for alcoholic  and substance-abusing liver transplant candidates to allow for a more comprehensive evaluation, but candidates with psychiatric illnesses are still assessed against general criteria. Should these candidates be assessed against their own criteria? On what clinical grounds do transplant teams justify excluding such candidates from transplantation? Is redress available for candidates who feel they have been unfairly refused a liver transplant simply because of their psychiatric illness? This essay will critically examine the provisions published by the Department of Health and NHSBT for the assessment of  liver transplant candidates with psychiatric illnesses, and will provide a commentary as to whether enough is being done to protect these particularly vulnerable candidates from inconsistent assessment decisions.;;Cherkassky L;;eng;['Donor Selection/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Ethics, Clinical', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', '*Liver Transplantation/ethics', 'Mental Disorders/*complications', 'Quality of Life', 'Vulnerable Populations'];;;;10.1136/jme.2011.042556
242;21945266;Article;2011;Reproductive biomedicine online;;Eggs-ploiting women: a critical feminist analysis of the different principles in  transplant and fertility tourism.;;Intergovernmental agencies have recognized that inconsistencies in the way that nation states regulate commerce in human kidneys lubricate transplant tourism, and have repeatedly exhorted recalcitrant governments of both organ-importing and organ-exporting nations to criminalize the exchange of cash for kidneys. Yet these same organizations have elected to remain silent on inconsistencies in the  regulation of the trade in human eggs that lubricate fertility tourism. This article is a critical feminist analysis of this paradox. Sketches of the histories of regulation of the global markets in human kidneys and human eggs allow attribution of the different approaches to sales of kidneys and eggs to the triumph of neo-liberalism in the 1990s. Neo-liberalism supports the growth of the medical tourism industry and its niche market catering for infertility, and is responsible for exacerbating the relative disadvantage of poor and powerless women in destination countries, thereby creating the conditions for 'bioavailability', that is, the willingness to exchange body parts for cash. The  paper identifies a disturbing correlation between deeply engrained conservative attitudes to women and a plentiful supply of eggs, and concludes by suggesting that what women need to lift themselves out of poverty and discrimination is secure and dignified work.;;Pfeffer N;;eng;['*Commodification', 'Female', '*Feminism', '*Government Regulation', 'Humans', '*Internationality', 'Medical Tourism/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Oocyte Donation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Poverty', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1016/j.rbmo.2011.08.005

Not only does transplantation offer improved quality of life and  increased longevity relative to dialysis, it also reduces end-stage renal disease program expenditures, providing savings to Medicare. Unfortunately, the waiting list for kidney transplants is long, growing, and unlikely to be substantially reduced by increases in the recovery of cadaveric kidneys. Another approach is to obtain more kidneys through payment to living ""donors,"" or vendors. Such direct commodification, in which a price is placed on kidneys, has generally been opposed by medical ethicists. Much of the ethical debate, however, has been in terms of commodification through market exchange. Recognizing that there are different ethical concerns associated with the purchase of kidneys and their allocation, it is possible to design a variety of institutional arrangements for  the commodification of kidneys that pose different sets of ethical concerns. We specify three such alternatives in detail sufficient to allow an assessment of their likely consequences and we compare these alternatives to current policy in  terms of the desirable goals of promoting human dignity, equity, efficiency, and  fiscal advantage.

However, a greater number  of scandals involving medical practitioners and others in the kidney trade has surfaced periodically in every state in India.

Currently in India, approximately 3500-4000 kidney transplants and 150-200 liver  transplants are performed annually. However, the availability of organs from brain-dead persons is very low.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the local ethics committee, with waived informed consent. All pediatric patients who  underwent liver transplantation between January 2000 and December 2003 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were followed up until June 2008, by using a  predefined US protocol with prospective documentation. Of 182 consecutive liver transplantations performed in 162 patients (mean age, 4.5 years; range, 0.1-18.4  years) in this period, 25 patients with a total of 27 liver transplantations underwent US examinations conducted by multiple investigators and were primarily  excluded. Student t tests and chi(2) tests were performed where appropriate. The  Tarone-Ware test was used to compare transplant survival times. RESULTS: Transcapsular arterial neovascularization was noticed in 13 of 137 patients (9.5%) and in 13 of 155 liver transplants (8.4%). The mean time until arterial neovessels appeared was 157 days after liver transplantation (median, 97 days; range, 19-477 days). Arterial neovascularization was associated with pronounced transplant malperfusion and inflammatory changes (P < .001). Patients with transcapsular arterial neovascularization had a significantly shorter mean transplant survival time (1426.4 days +/- 244.5 [standard error], with 95% confidence interval: 947.23, 1905.23, vs 2526.4 days +/- 92.1, with 95% confidence interval: 2345.84, 2706.97; P = .008) and a higher retransplantation rate (53.8% vs 19.7%, P = .009). CONCLUSION: Transcapsular arterial neovascularization, detected with color Doppler US, occurred in 9.5% (13 of 137)  of pediatric patients and 8.4% (13 of 155) of liver transplants and was associated with underlying malperfusion and inflammation. The diagnosis of transcapsular arterial neovascularization was associated with reduced graft survival times and a high retransplantation rate.

At least for many such people, an instance of this duty is to allow their vital organs to be used for transplantation. Accordingly, 'opt-out' organ procurement policies, based on a powerfully motivated responsibility to render costless or very low-cost lifesaving aid, would seem presumptively permissible. Counterarguments abound. Here I consider, in particular, objections that assign a moral distinctiveness to the physical boundaries of our bodies and that concern autonomy and trust. These objections are singled out as they seem particularly pertinent to the stress I place on a distinctive benefit of the particular policy I defend. An opt-out system, resting not on the authority of 'presumed consent' but on the recognition of a duty to one another, has the prospect of prompting people to understand more richly the ways in which they are both physically embodied and communally embedded.";;Nelson JL;;eng;['Coercion', 'Ethical Theory', 'Humans', 'Moral Obligations', 'Patient Rights/*ethics', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Presumed Consent/*ethics', '*Social Responsibility', '*Tissue Donors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Trust', 'United States'];;;;10.1007/s11017-011-9192-y

However, there exists a sizeable discrepancy between the supply and demand of organs, especially in developing countries, where lack of expertise, financial constraints, and inadequate transplant facilities have been obstacles. According  to current practice, donors must be dead before unpaired vital organs can be recovered. Equal health warrants needs-based health care for everyone. Recovering viable organs from donors while they are alive, but with death inevitable, may be significant to persons on waiting lists. Future policies in organ transplantation must be made after thorough consideration of all aspects of donation and dealing  with the inequalities of health care.

We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of autologous non-myeloablative HSCT in a phase 2 trial compared with the standard of care, cyclophosphamide. METHODS: In our open-label, randomised, controlled phase 2 trial, we consecutively enrolled patients at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Chicago, IL, USA) who were aged younger than 60 years with diffuse systemic sclerosis, modified Rodnan skin scores (mRSS) of more than 14, and internal organ involvement or restricted skin involvement (mRSS <14) but coexistent pulmonary involvement. We randomly allocated patients 1:1 by use of a  computer-generated sequence with a mixed block design (blocks of ten and four) to receive HSCT, 200 mg/kg intravenous cyclophosphamide, and 6.5 mg/kg intravenous rabbit antithymocyte globulin or to receive 1.0 g/m(2) intravenous cyclophosphamide once per month for 6 months. The primary outcome for all enrolled patients was improvement at 12 months' follow-up, defined as a decrease  in mRSS (>25% for those with initial mRSS >14) or an increase in forced vital capacity by more than 10%. Patients in the control group with disease progression (>25% increase in mRSS or decrease of >10% in forced vital capacity) despite treatment with cyclophosphamide could switch to HSCT 12 months after enrolment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00278525. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2006, and Nov 10, 2009 we enrolled 19 patients. All ten patients  randomly allocated to receive HSCT improved at or before 12 months' follow-up, compared with none of nine allocated to cyclophosphamide (odds ratio 110, 95% CI  14.04-infinity; p=0.00001). Eight of nine controls had disease progression (without interval improvement) compared with no patients treated by HSCT (p=0.0001), and seven patients switched to HSCT. Compared with baseline, data for 11 patients with follow-up to 2 years after HSCT suggested that improvements in mRSS (p<0.0001) and forced vital capacity (p<0.03) persisted. INTERPRETATION: Non-myeloablative autologous HSCT improves skin and pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis for up to 2 years and is preferable to the current standard of care, but longer follow-up is needed.

METHODS: The literature search included all articles retrievable for the hit ""transplantation in elderly  recipients"" between 1960 and 2010. For quality search the inclusion criteria were as follows: older than 60 years and transplanted kidney, liver, heart, lung or pancreas from a deceased or living donor. We focussed on parameters concerning quality of life, frailty, nutritional status/weight loss, drugs/interactions/polypharmacy, gait/osteoporosis/fracture, delirium/dementia and geriatric assessment to address physical and psychosocial functionality of elderly recipients. RESULTS: The initial hit list contained 1427 citations from electronic databases. 249 abstracts thereof were selected for full review. A total of 60 articles met final inclusion criteria. Finally, only five studies met the qualitative inclusion criteria as listed above. CONCLUSION: The number of elderly patients placed on waiting lists has increased dramatically and will further grow. Interdisciplinary collaboration and distinct patient selection is recommended in most of the studies.

The Milan criteria (single nodule up to 5 cm, up to three nodules none larger than 3 cm, with no evidence of extrahepatic spread or macrovascular invasion) have been traditionally accepted as standard of care. However, some groups have proposed that these criteria are too restrictive, and exclude some patients from transplantation who might benefit from this procedure. Transplanting patients with tumors beyond the established criteria falls into two categories, those whose tumors are beyond the Milan criteria at presentation without the use of treatment prior to transplantation (expanded criteria), and those in whom treatment allows the Milan Criteria to be  fulfilled (down-staging). Currently, however, there is no international consensus regarding these approaches in clinical practice. The purpose of this systematic review is to clarify this debate through a critical analysis of available data.

This belief is codified in several national and European documents. This so-called 'no-property rule' is held to be the default position across the countries of the European Union. However, a closer look at the most pertinent national and European documents, and also current practices in the field, reveals a gradual model of commercialisation of human tissue. In particular, we will argue that the ban on commercialisation of body material is not as strict as it may appear at first sight, leaving room for the commercial practice of tissue procurement and transfer.

Since consent for liver transplantation in patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is typically performed by surrogates and these patients typically regain decisional capacity, we chose this population to query patients' opinion on the surrogate consent process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a questionnaire that queried transplanted patients' experience and opinion on surrogate consent, suitability of surrogates, and return of decisional capacity.  This survey was then sent to consecutive survivors of liver transplantation for FHF at our institution. RESULTS: Eleven of 14 patients eligible to participate completed the questionnaire. The mean follow-up for all survivors was 41 mo, with a range of survival since transplant of 5 mo to 10 y. Although 10/11 respondents  agreed with their surrogates to consent to liver transplantation, all 11 patients thought that surrogates should not be able to decline liver transplantation for this condition. In distinction, 3/11 patients believed patients could decline liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that liver transplant patients do not think surrogate decision-makers should be permitted to contravene physician recommendations regarding transplant. In clinical settings when patients cannot speak for themselves, it may be appropriate for surrogates and clinicians to act together according to the patients' best interest rather than attempt to determine what the patient would want. This approach might reduce surrogate distress, better represent patient preferences, and improve the decision-making process for affected patients.;;Brewster LP, Palmatier J, Manley CJ, Hall DE, Brems JJ;;eng;['Adult', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure, Acute/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Advocacy', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires'];;;;10.1016/j.jss.2011.04.042
292;21693271;Article;2011;Transplantation proceedings;;Suitable calcineurin inhibitor concentrations for liver transplant recipients in  the Chinese population.;;AIM: The aim was to deduce suitable calcineurin inhibitor concentrations for the  Chinese liver transplantation population. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 97  liver transplant recipients who displayed stable liver and renal function. No grafts were obtained from prisoners, procurements were performed with donor consent conforming to international ethics regulations. At 3, 6, and 12 months, we increased the concentrations and doses of calcineurin inhibitors as well as the values of alanine transaminase and serum creatinine. RESULTS: Twenty-eight recipients received cyclosporine and 69 tacrolimus. The mean cyclosporine daily dosages were 203 +/- 62 mg at 3, 188 +/- 55 mg at 6, and 173 +/- 52 mg at 12 months, the tacrolimus daily dosages were 3.08 +/- 0.98, 2.82 +/- 0.98, and 2.58  +/- 0.93 mg, respectively. The corresponding mean cyclosporine peak concentrations (C(2)) were 806 +/- 322 ng/mL, 681 +/- 206 ng/mL, and 644 +/- 190  ng/mL and the mean tacrolimus trought concentrations (C(0)) 6.61 +/- 3.02 ng/mL,  5.85 +/- 2.44 ng/mL, and 5.22 +/- 2.33 ng/mL, respectively. In both groups, transaminases and serum creatinine were stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized immunosuppressive regimen for the local population is necessary. We delayed calcineurin inhibitors with subsequent low-dose mycophenolate mofetil  plus minimized calcineurin inhibitors, which seemed to be nephroprotective and safe for Chinese liver transplantation patients.;;Chen YB, Li SD, Ju BL, Shi XJ, Lu F, Hu DK, Yu CH, Dong JH;;eng;['Adult', '*Calcineurin Inhibitors', 'China', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/blood', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tacrolimus/*administration & dosage/blood'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.11.025

RESULTS: CsA significantly increased serum lipid concentrations. The CsA concentration correlated positively with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels, whereas FK506 showed no significant effect on serum lipid level. There was a positive correlation between the CsA concentrations and the expression of CD36; FK507 showed no significant effect on CD36 expression.

294;21681668;Article;2011;Frontiers of medicine;;Partial liver transplantation.;;Partial liver transplantation, including reducedsize liver transplantation, split liver transplantation, and living donor liver transplantation, has been developed with several innovative techniques because of donor shortage. Reduced-size liver  transplantation is based on Couinaud's anatomical classification, benefiting children and small adult recipients but failing to relieve the overall donor shortage. Split liver transplantation provides chances to two or even more recipients when only one liver graft is available. The splitting technique must follow stricter anatomical and physiological criteria either ex situ or in situ to ensure long-term quality. The first and most important issue involving living  donor liver transplantation is donor safety. Before surgery, a series of donor evaluations-including anatomical, liver volume, and liver function evaluations-is indispensable, followed by ethnic agreement. At different recipient conditions, auxiliary liver transplantation and auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation, which employ piggyback techniques, are good alternatives.

300;21649566;Article;2011;Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation;;Expanding the live kidney donor pool: ethical considerations regarding altruistic donors, paired and pooled programs.;;"In renal transplant, there is a well-known deficiency in organ supply relative to demand. Live donation provides superior results when compared with deceased donation including a better rate of graft success and fewer immunologic complications. This deficiency in organs leads to significant morbidity and mortality rates. Alternative avenues have been extensively explored that may expand the live donor pool. They include altruistic donation as well as paired and pooled exchange programs. Altruistic donation is a truly selfless act from a  donor unknown to the recipient. Kidney paired donation involves 2 incompatible donor-recipient pairs swapping donors to produce compatibility. Pooled donation involves at least 2 pairs, and can take the form of domino chains in which altruistic input sets up a chain of transplants, in which each recipient's incompatible donor makes a donation for the next recipient. Despite application of these various methods, there lie extensive ethical issues surrounding them. Misconceptions frequently occur; for instance, the perceived benefit that donating an organ to a loved one is greater for a related donor than for an altruistic one. Additionally, it is frequently believed that immunologic incompatibility offers coerced donors liberation from surgery, and that overcoming these barriers by introducing exchange programs provides vulnerable donors less protection. This article explores these and other complex ethical issues surrounding the various methods of expanding the donor pool.

301;21645048;Article;2012;Journal of advanced nursing;;Intensive care nurses' perceptions of their professional competence in the organ  donor process: a national survey.;;AIMS: This paper is a report of a study that explored Norwegian intensive care nurses' perceptions of their professional competence to identify educational needs in the organ donor process. BACKGROUND: Intensive care professionals are requested to consider organ donation each time they care for patients with severe cerebral lesion to ensure donor organs for transplantation. The donor process challenges intensive care nurses' professional competence. Nurses' knowledge and  experience may influence their professional competence in caring for organ donors and their relatives. METHODS.: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in all 28 Norwegian donor hospitals between October 2008 and January 2009. Intensive care nurses (N = 801) were invited to participate and the response rate was 71.4%. Dimensions of professional competence, learning needs and contextual and demographic variables were explored. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. FINDINGS: Few intensive care nurses had extensive experience of or competence and training in organ donation. Nurses working at university hospitals had more experience, but lesser training than nurses in local hospitals. Experience of donor acquisition had an impact on intensive care  nurses' perceptions of their professional competence in the donor process. Discussions on the ward and educational input were seen as important for the further development of professional competence. CONCLUSION: Training provided by  experienced colleagues and a culture that encourages discussion about aspects of  the donor process can develop nurses' professional competence and communally defined professional practice. Educational input that cultivates various types of knowledge can be beneficial in organ donation.;;Meyer K, Bjork IT, Eide H;;eng;"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Death', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Decision Making', 'Family/psychology', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', 'Norway', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Nursing Staff, Hospital/education/psychology/*standards', '*Professional Competence', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Self-Assessment', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*organization & administration/standards']";;;;10.1111/j.1365-2648.2011.05721.x

We aimed to determine the survival, morbidity, and developmental outcomes of young children after heart transplant. METHODS: All children under 6 years of age having a heart transplant in Edmonton between 1999  and 2006 were included in this inception cohort study. Demographics, pretransplant, transplant, and posttransplant variables were collected. The association of potentially predictive variables with neurodevelopmental outcomes  at least 12 months posttransplant were determined by univariate and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-three children had a heart transplant; 18 with congenital heart disease (CHD) and 15 with cardiomyopathy-myocarditis (non-CHD). Mortality during 19 (8) months of follow-up was 12% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3% to 28%). Survivors had frequent low weight (28%) and height (31%), and delay in language (41%), motor (52%), mental (34%), and general adaptive composite (48%) scores. Only CHD was associated with death-disability-mental delay on multiple regression (odds ratio 7.94; 95% CI 1.6 to 39.4, p=0.011). The CHD was also associated with mental and language delay on  multiple regressions. Mental delay occurred in 8 (53%) with CHD and 2 (14%) with  non-CHD (p=0.05). Mental score of 85 or greater was found in 13.4% of patients with CHD compared with 50% with non-CHD (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center inception cohort study, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in survivors of heart transplant before the age 6 years were common, particularly in those with CHD.

Teams may need to employ limit setting in order to ensure fair and consistent care for all patients on the ward, and to prevent escalation of emotionally charged situations.;;Bramstedt KA, Popovich M;;eng;['Abdominal Pain/therapy', 'Accidental Falls', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Family/*psychology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hematoma, Subdural, Acute/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics', 'Medical Futility', 'Patient Care Management/*ethics', 'Physicians/*ethics', 'Prognosis', 'Shock, Septic/therapy'];;;;

In the first approach, lungs from donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors are used to increase the quantity of organ donors. In the second approach, a newly developed normothermic ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) technique is used as a means of reassessing the adequacy of lung function from DCD and from high-risk brain death donors prior to transplantation.

We investigate alterations during the three phases of requirements for intraoperative isoflurane within the target of 40 to 55 Bispectral Index (BIS) values concerning patients with end-stage liver disease who are undergoing liver transplantation. After faculty ethics committee approval, we studied 50 patients of (age range, 18 to 65 years) who were undergoing liver transplantation. After induction, we used isoflurane with air/oxygen (FiO(2) = 0.5%) for anesthetic maintenance. The isoflurane concentration was set within the range of 40 to 55 BIS values. Remifentanil (0.15 mug/kg/min) was infused for analgesia and cisatracurium was administered via continuous infusion. After anesthetic induction, we inserted arterial, pulmonary artery, and central venous catheters. The heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), body temperature, BIS values, end-tidal isoflurane concentration (ETiso) and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO(2)) were recorded at 30-minute intervals during the dissection and neohepatic phases, at 15-minute intervals during the anhepatic phase. In addition, we calculated the cardiac index during the three phases. There was no difference in heart rates among the operative phases. In contrast, there were significant changes in MAP, MPAP, BIS, ETCO(2) and body temperature values. However, all of these parameters were in physiological ranges and clinically acceptable. The ETiso values were lowest in the anhepatic phase compared to other phases, but the differences were not clinically important. The  ETiso values in the dissection and neohepatic phases were compared with the anhepatic phase higher 5% and 8.6% respectively. During liver transplantation, ETiso requirement for the anhepatic phase was lower compared with the other two phases within the range of 40 to 55 BIS values.;;Toprak HI, Sener A, Gedik E, Ucar M, Karahan K, Aydogan MS, Ersoy MO;;eng;['Adult', 'Anesthetics, Inhalation/*administration & dosage', 'End Stage Liver Disease/*surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoflurane/*administration & dosage', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.11.023

We reviewed the outcomes of our exchange series. METHODS: Between July 2003 and August 2010 we performed 110 exchange donor transplantations in four hospitals: one four-way, two three-way, and 100 two-way  cases. Donors were mostly spouses (n = 71) or mothers (n = 15). The mean age of the donors was 48.8 (range = 23-69) and the recipients 41.4 years (range = 5-66). Two were transplanted preemptively and the others had a mean dialysis duration of 43 months (range = 1-120). RESULTS: Among 110 patients, three compatible pairs joined the group voluntarily; 71, due to ABO incompatibility and 36, due to crossmatch positivity. Induction therapy was used in 92 patients. HLA mismatches  (MM) were: one MM in three; two MM in three; three MM in 18, four MM in 36; five  MM in 34; and six MM in 18. Among 90 patients tested for panel-reactive antibodies PRA, five showed class I and 10, class II positivity. In 11 patients,  B-cell positivity was detected by flow cytometry. Delayed graft function (n = 2), acute rejection (n = 11), BK virus infection (n = 1), and cytomegalovirus infection (n = 3) were seen postoperatively. Three (2.7%) patients died due to sepsis. Five patients returned to dialysis program due to interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy (IFTA) (n = 2), renal vein thrombosis (n = 1), de novo glomerulopathy (n = 1), or primary nonfunction (n = 1). The 1- and 5-year patient and graft survival rates were 96% and 96%, 95% and 89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We believe that exchange donor transplantation is as successful as direct transplants; it is a good, ethical alternative to unrelated living transplantations.";;Gurkan A, Kacar S, Varilsuha C, Tilif S, Turunc V, Dogan M, Dheir H, Sahin S;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', '*Ethics', 'Family', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.11.022

The study was performed in 54  male recipients of a liver transplant. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their relatives, and the study protocol was approved by our local Clinical Research (Ethics) Committee. Male patients were classified into two groups: group 1 included patients with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis (n = 30) distributed as 19 men with no ascites, four with nonrefractory ascites, and seven with refractory ascites; group 2 included cases of viral hepatitis cirrhosis (n = 24) distributed as 13 men with no ascites, nine with non-refractory ascites, and  two with refractory ascites. A group of six healthy male volunteers was used to establish normal (basal) values of pro-BNP and left auricular diameter (LAD). Pro-BNP values were determined in plasma samples by an electrochemiluminiscence immunoassay. Pro-BNP plasma levels in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were threefold greater among patients with no ascites or no refractory ascites compared with healthy men, whereas pro-BNP values were fivefold enhanced among alcoholic patients with refractory ascites. The viral hepatitis cirrhosis group showed pro-BNP plasma values 1.5-fold enhanced in men with no ascites, whereas pro-BNP reached fivefold with either nonrefractory or refractory ascites. The enhanced pro-BNP plasma levels indicated advanced hepatic degradation, seemingly  related to the presence of refractory ascites associated with cirrhosis.";;Espinosa MD, Olmedo C, Muffak-Granero K, Comino A, Nogueras MF, Villegas MT, Becerra A, Garrote D, Bueno P, Ferron JA;;eng;['Ascites/*blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/methods', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Luminescence', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Preoperative Period'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2011.01.086

In some situations though, the length of a person's life is not as vital as the quality of that life. As a member of a transplant team, one must recognize the differences between quality and quantity and apply the ethical principles of  autonomy, justice, nonmaleficence, and beneficence. When a lung transplant recipient became ill with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease 10 months after her surgery, these ethical principles came to the foreground. This dynamic, vibrant woman, recently engaged, faced her own mortality with grace. There is a time for everything. When death is a long time coming, many people are referred to hospice care and the death is viewed as a blessing. This situation rarely occurs in the transplant field.

The major sources of organs are deceased donors after brain death; however, a substantial number of organs come from live donations, and a significant number can also be obtained from non-heart-beating donors. Yet, despite progress in medical, pharmacologic, and surgical techniques, the shortage of organs is a worldwide problem that needs to be addressed internationally at the highest possible levels. This particular field involves medical ethics, religion, and society behavior and beliefs. Some of the critical ethical issues that require aggressive interference are organ trafficking, payments for organs, and the delicate balance in live donations between the benefit to the recipient and the possible harm to the donor and others. A major issue in organ transplantation is the definition of death and particularly brain death. Another major critical factor is the internal tendency of a specific society to donate organs.

This study involved a retrospective observational cohort. Records of patients supported with the BH VAD were reviewed. Data regarding age, sex, weight, diagnosis, preoperative condition, single versus biventricular support, morbidity, and mortality were collected. Criteria for single versus biventricular support and intensive care unit management were registered. The procedure was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained. Between March 2006 and March 2010, 12 patients with diagnosis of dilated (n = 10) and restrictive (n = 2) cardiomyopathy were supported. Median age was 56.6 months (range 20.1-165.9); mean weight was 18.3 kg (range 8.5-45); and nine patients were female.

The role of the teacher is crucial in this respect. The objective of this study was to determine acceptance by secondary school teachers of an educational program about ODT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A random sample of secondary school teachers was taken from 10 secondary schools in the southeast of Spain. A total of 288 teachers were surveyed using a questionnaire that assessed the following; (1) acceptance of the educational program; (2) who should carry it out; and (3) some psychosocial variables related to ODT. RESULTS: Of the 288 secondary teachers surveyed, 283 of them responded to the acceptance of an educational program on ODT. Approximately half (54%) of the  respondents believed that it would be appropriate to introduce an educational program about ODT in secondary schools, 22% believed that there were currently other more important educational considerations, 20% had doubts, and 4% believed  that it would not be useful. The vast majority (71%) believed that a collaborator from the Regional Transplant Team would be the best person to carry out the program followed by any teacher (11%) or a teacher of ethics (9%). The remaining  9% were not sure. There was greater acceptance of an educational program about ODT among teachers who had a favorable attitude toward the matter (P = .003).

336;21327773;Article;2011;Seminars in immunopathology;;Clinical transplantation tolerance.;;Transplantation is the treatment of choice for many if not most causes of end-stage organ failure. Over 20,000 organ transplant procedures were performed in the USA in 2009 to treat patients with failed or failing kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, and intestines, and there remain 85,000 individuals waiting on the transplant list. Currently, in the USA, there are over 170,000 individuals living with a transplanted organ. Virtually, all of these individuals receive maintenance immunosuppression in an attempt to maximize the function and survival of the transplanted organ. However, it is clear that the long-term use of immunosuppressive agents is associated with an extensive list of undesirable side effects that have the potential to limit the survival of the patient and transplanted organ as well as to compromise quality of life. Although the ability to induce reproducibly a state of robust, stable tolerance would address this problem, tolerance remains an infrequent event in clinical transplantation that is largely a consequence of chance. Factors limiting the broader investigation of clinical transplantation tolerance include the lack of therapeutic regimens known to favor tolerance in humans, the lack of validated assays or biomarkers predictive of tolerance, and concerns about the safety and ethics of complete withdrawal of immunosuppression given the very good results achievable with current immunosuppression. Despite these barriers, a number of investigators have continued to conduct well-designed and carefully supervised studies with the long-term goal of making clinical transplantation tolerance more feasible. The aim of this review is to summarize the status of these studies.;;Newell KA;;eng;['Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/genetics/immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Kidney Transplantation/immunology', 'Liver Transplantation/immunology', 'Transplantation Tolerance/genetics/*immunology'];;;;10.1007/s00281-011-0255-y

This retrospective review included 178 consecutive patients (111 male, 67 female; mean age, 43.9 years +/- 13.4 [standard deviation]; age range, 16-72 years) undergoing first deceased-donor renal transplantation between 1997 and 2000. All patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Spectral Doppler analysis was performed within 1 week after transplantation in all patients and between 1 week and 3 months after transplantation in 124 patients. Average PI and RI were determined from measurements obtained in the upper, lower, and interpolar regions. For statistical analysis, the chi(2) test, analysis of variance, the Student t test, Kaplan-Meier survival plots, and Cox proportional hazards models  were used. RESULTS: Within 1 week after transplantation, there was a significant  association between PI and 1-year eGFR when analyzed as tertiles (P = .02). Between 1 week and 3 months after transplantation, there was a significant relationship between 1-year eGFR and both PI and RI when comparing the lowest and highest tertiles (47.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for PI <1.26 vs 32.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for PI >1.49 [P = .01], 42.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for RI <0.69 vs 32.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for RI >0.74 [P = .03]). Both PI and RI were independent predictors of death-censored transplant survival (hazard ratio, 1.68 per unit [P < .001] and 260.4 per unit, respectively [P = .02]). CONCLUSION: PI and RI in the early posttransplantation period correlate with long-term transplant function and can potentially be used as prognostic markers to aid risk stratification for future transplant dysfunction.";;McArthur C, Geddes CC, Baxter GM;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Kidney Function Tests/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Kidney Transplantation/*diagnostic imaging/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Scotland/epidemiology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Vascular Resistance', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1148/radiol.10101329

Unfortunately, given the marked shortage of  cadaveric liver donations and the ethical questions that plague utilization of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for ALF, many patients with ALF die before a liver is allocated to them. In this review, we discuss how the consistent utilization of LDLT for ALF could decrease the mortality rate of ALF.  Additionally, we examine a key underlying issue: is LDLT for ALF ethically appropriate?;;Carlisle EM, Angelos P, Siegler M, Testa G;;eng;['Adult', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure, Acute/*therapy', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics'];;;;10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01413.x
339;21310675;Article;2011;Nephrologie & therapeutique;;[Outcome and outlook of living donor kidney transplantation activity in France].;;INTRODUCTION: In France, the bioethic law of 2004 authorized the extension of the living donor (LD) pool to members of the extended family and any person justifying of a 2 year-long relationship. The number of living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) increased until reaching a maximum of 246 grafts in 2006 (9% of total activity). Two years later, in 2008, LKG activity slowed down to 7.6% of the total activity (222 grafts). METHODS: We analyzed all LDKT carried out in France since 2000 according to various indicators. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to renal transplant teams in order to identify potential causes for the decrease in LKG observed in France. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2006, over 1400 LDKT were performed in France. However, donor to recipient relations show that the large increase observed in 2006 was not linked to the extension of  the LD pool. LDKT activity then started decreasing as soon as 2007. The questionnaire was sent back by 40/44 (91%) renal transplant teams. Their answers  led to the identification of potential constrain impacting LDKT activity in France. Among these obstacles: workload and time-consuming to prepare the transplantation and the donor, ethical constrains and lack of appropriate communication and information delivered to the professionals. DISCUSSION: The important increase in LKG activity in 2006 is not clearly understood. However, several approaches to develop the activity in the next years have been identified.;;Lamy FX, Savoye E, Macher MA, Thuong M;;fre;['Communication', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'France/epidemiology', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence/*statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Living Donors/legislation & jurisprudence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Patient Care Team', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Workload'];;;;10.1016/j.nephro.2011.01.001

Working within the current legal  framework in the USA, I examine whether ovarian tissue should be legally treated  like gametes or organs in the case of ovarian tissue transplantation between two  women.

347;21239479;Article;2011;Scandinavian journal of public health;;Incentivizing deceased organ donation: a Swedish priority-setting perspective.;;"AIMS: The established deceased organ donation models in many countries, relying chiefly on altruism, have failed to motivate a sufficient number of donors. As a  consequence organs that could save lives are routinely missed leading to a growing gap between demand and supply. The aim of this paper is twofold; firstly  to develop a proposal for compensated deceased organ donation that could potentially address the organ shortage; secondly to examine the compatibility of  the proposal with the ethical values of the Swedish healthcare system. METHODS: The proposal for compensating deceased donation is grounded in behavioural agency theory and combines extrinsic, intrinsic and signalling incentives in order to increase prosocial behaviour. Furthermore the compatibility of our proposal with  the values of the Swedish healthcare system is evaluated in reference to the principles of human dignity, needs and solidarity, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Extrinsic incentives in the form of a 5,000 compensation towards funeral expenses paid to the estate of the deceased or family is proposed. Intrinsic and  signalling incentives are incorporated by allowing all or part of the compensation to be diverted as a donation to a reputable charity. The decision for organ donation must not be against the explicit will of the donor. CONCLUSIONS: We find that our proposal for compensated deceased donation is compatible with the values of the Swedish healthcare system, and therefore merits serious consideration. It is however important to acknowledge issues relating to  coercion, commodification and loss of public trust and the ethical challenges that they might pose.";;Omar F, Tinghog G, Welin S;;eng;['Commerce/ethics', 'Compensation and Redress/ethics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', '*Motivation', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics/ethics', 'Sweden', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/ethics'];;;;10.1177/1403494810391522

However, randomized clinical trials are needed to quantify the extent to which specific interventions might enhance organ recovery  and outcomes among transplant recipients. Among several barriers to conducting such studies are the absence of guidelines for obtaining informed consent for such studies and the fact that deceased organ donors are not covered by extant federal regulations governing oversight of research with human subjects. This article explores the underexamined ethical issues that arise in the context of donor management studies and provides ethical guidelines and suggested regulatory oversight mechanisms to enable such studies to be conducted ethically. We conclude that both the respect that is traditionally accorded to the prior wishes of the dead and the possibility of postmortem harm support a role for surrogate consent of donors in such randomized controlled trials. Furthermore, although recipients will often be considered human subjects under federal regulations, several ethical arguments support waiving requirements for recipient consent in donor management randomized controlled trials. Finally, we suggest that new regulatory mechanisms, perhaps linked to existing regional and national organ donation and transplantation infrastructures, must be established to protect patients in donor management studies while limiting unnecessary barriers to the conduct of this important research.;;Rey MM, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Bernard GR, McGuire AL, Caplan AL, Halpern SD;;eng;['Biomedical Research/*ethics', 'Cadaver', 'Critical Illness/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Male', 'Needs Assessment', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Presumed Consent/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/methods/*organization & administration', 'Total Quality Management', 'United States'];;;R01 HL087115/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181feeb04

Especially in patients with chronic heart failure, the ethical and medico-legal issues associated with providing maximal possible care or withholding the same are coming to the forefront. Procedures, such as cardiac  transplantation, have strict criteria for adequate candidacy. These criteria for  subsequent listing are based on clinical outcome data but also reflect the reality of organ shortage. Lack of compliance and non-adherence to lifestyle changes represent relative contraindications to heart transplant candidacy. Mechanical circulatory support therapy using ventricular assist devices is becoming a more prominent therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart failure who are not candidates for transplantation, which also requires strict criteria to enable beneficial outcome for the patient. Physicians need to critically reflect that in many cases, the patient's best interest might not always mean pursuing maximal technological options available.

358;20002070;Article;2011;Bioethics;;The ongoing charity of organ donation. Contemporary English Sunni fatwas on organ donation and blood transfusion.;;BACKGROUND: Empirical studies in Muslim communities on organ donation and blood transfusion show that Muslim counsellors play an important role in the decision process. Despite the emerging importance of online English Sunni fatwas, these fatwas on organ donation and blood transfusion have hardly been studied, thus creating a gap in our knowledge of contemporary Islamic views on the subject. METHOD: We analysed 70 English Sunni e-fatwas and subjected them to an in-depth text analysis in order to reveal the key concepts in the Islamic ethical framework regarding organ donation and blood transfusion. RESULTS: All 70 fatwas  allow for organ donation and blood transfusion. Autotransplantation is no problem at all if done for medical reasons. Allotransplantation, both from a living and a dead donor, appears to be possible though only in quite restricted ways. Xenotransplantation is less often mentioned but can be allowed in case of necessity. Transplantation in general is seen as an ongoing form of charity. Nearly half of the fatwas allowing blood transfusion do so without mentioning any restriction or problem whatsoever. The other half of the fatwas on transfusion contain the same conditional approval as found in the arguments pro organ transplantation. CONCLUSION: Our findings are very much in line with the international literature on the subject. We found two new elements: debates on the definition of the moment of death are hardly mentioned in the English Sunni fatwas and organ donation and blood transfusion are presented as an ongoing form  of charity.;;Van den Branden S, Broeckaert B;;eng;['*Blood Transfusion', 'Cadaver', 'Humans', '*Islam', 'Living Donors', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Transplantation, Autologous/ethics', 'Transplantation, Homologous/ethics'];;;;10.1111/j.1467-8519.2009.01782.x

370;23278568;Article;2014;Bioethics;;To donate a kidney: public perspectives from Pakistan.;;Despite the majority opinion of Muslim jurists that organ donation is permitted in Sharia, surveys indicate continuing resistance by lay Muslims, especially to donating organs following death. Pakistan, a country with 165 million Muslims, currently reliant on live donors, is considering steps to establish deceased donor programs which will require public acceptance and support. This article analyzes the results of in-depth interviews with 105 members of the public focusing on opinions and knowledge about juristic rulings regarding kidney donations, donor-family dynamics in deceased donation decisions, and attitudes towards buying kidneys. The objective was to determine the influence if any of cultural and religious values, and norms of traditional family structures and kinships, on decisions to donate. Study participants view donation of kidneys, particularly from the deceased, through a different lens from that used by jurists and physicians, one that also does not conform to familiar paradigms defining ethical organ donation. A socially modulated understanding of Islam passed down the generations, and longstanding family-centric norms, shape the moral worldview of many rather than academic juristic rulings or non-contextual concepts of autonomy and rights. The results of this study also highlight that medical science may be universal but its application occurs within particularities of cultural and religious values, social constructs of the self and its relationship with others, and different ways in which humans comprehend illness, suffering, and death. These findings are of relevance both to transplant related professionals and bioethicists involved with this field.;;Moazam F, Jafarey AM, Shirazi B;;eng;['Adult', '*Attitude', '*Culture', 'Data Collection', 'Death', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', '*Islam', 'Kidney', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Morals', 'Pakistan', '*Public Opinion', 'Religion and Medicine', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics', 'Young Adult'];['Muslims and kidney donation', 'Sharia and transplantation', 'organ donation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12010
371;23274332;Article;2012;Annals of transplantation;;The value of living donor liver transplantation.;;Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a very successful procedure that develops liver resources in case of worldwide shortages. As the technology has developed so much in the past 2 decades, LDLT has the same good prognosis as DDLT. However, LDLT still has lots of ethical & technical problems. It causes great psychiatric, physical and psychosocial harm to donors. Also, it has some negative effects on society by providing a platform for organ trade. Therefore, there is much controversy about the social value of LDLT. After review of recent  papers, we find much progress can be made in inspiring the public to become organ donors and creating donation model new to improve the consent rate for solid organ donation from deceased donors. That is the key strategy for increasing the  liver supply. With this serious shortage of organs, liver donor transplantation still has its advantages, but we should not place all our hopes on LDLT to increase the liver supply. We all need to try our best to increase donor awareness and promote organ donor registration--when cadaver organs could meet the needs for liver transplantation, living donor liver transplants would not be  necessary.;;Yang X, Gong J, Gong J;;eng;['Hepatectomy/psychology', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*methods', '*Living Donors/education/ethics/psychology/supply & distribution', 'Postoperative Complications', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/methods/organization & administration'];;;;10.12659/aot.883702

METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional survey with 158 medical residents in order to assess the views of physicians in training regarding the informed consent as autonomous authorization in pediatrics. The study was conducted with volunteer participants, from a limited geographical area (Bucharest and surrounding areas). RESULTS: Most respondents strongly agreed that a patient aged 16-18 years should make informed  medical decisions regarding any type of procedures (including reproductive choices), whilst those aged 14-16 should be allowed to take informed medical decisions regarding minor procedures only. Most participants agreed that transplant procedures involving bone marrow should be allowed between siblings if they approve, whilst most disagreed allowing solid organ transplantation. The involvement of children in clinical studies should only be allowed if the children agree. CONCLUSIONS: The responses obtained in our study regarding the informed consent put it closer to the autonomic authorization sense than the effective authorization sense. Therefore, respondents' moral intuition is more bioethical and less legal, which, even if maximizing the patient's benefit, is associated with an increased liability risk. However, since the newer generations become more and more precocious, a reanalysis of the classical competence dogmas  should be conducted.;;Hostiuc S;;eng;['Child', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Mental Competency/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patient Participation', 'Pediatrics', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Physicians/*psychology', 'Romania'];;;;10.2223/JPED.2236

Although transplant is considered the standard treatment for advanced heart failure, limits in organ availability leave a much larger pool of recipients in need versus donors. MCS is used as bridge to transplantation and as destination therapy (DT) for patients who will have MCS as their final invasive therapy with transplant not being an option. Despite improvements in quality of life (QOL) and survival, defining the optimal  candidate for DT may raise questions regarding the economics of this approach as  well as ethical concerns regarding just distribution of goods and services.

The number of donors has since reached a steady plateau far below its initial peak. In this review we evaluate the current climate of AALDLT. Specifically, we focus on several issues key to the success of AALDLT: determining the optimal indications for AALDLT, balancing  graft size and donor safety, assuring adequate outflow, minimizing biliary complications, and maintaining ethical practices.

I give a legal analysis of each. In concluding remarks on their potential practical viability, I emphasise the importance not just of ascertaining the legal and ethical acceptability of these and other forms of elective ventilation, but also  of assessing their professional and political acceptability.

379;23221167;Article;2012;American journal of nephrology;;Obesity and kidney transplant candidates: how big is too big for transplantation?.;;Obesity impacts many inter-related, and sometimes conflicting, considerations for transplant practice. In this article, we describe an approach for applying available data on the importance of body composition to the kidney transplant population that separates implications for candidate selection, risk stratification among selected candidates, and interventions to optimize health of the individual. Transplant recipients with obesity defined by elevated body mass  index (BMI) have been shown in many (but not all) studies to experience an array  of adverse outcomes more commonly than normal-weight transplant recipients, including wound infections, delayed graft function, graft failure, cardiac disease, and increased costs. However, current studies have not defined limits of body composition that preclude clinical benefit from transplantation compared with long-term dialysis in patients who have passed a transplant evaluation. Formal cost-effectiveness studies are needed to determine if payers and society should be compensating centers for clinical and financial risks of transplanting  obese end-stage renal disease patients. Recent studies also demonstrate the limitations of BMI alone as a measure of adiposity, and further research should be pursued to define practical measures of body composition that refine accuracy  for outcomes prediction. Regarding individual management, observational registry  studies have not found beneficial associations of pretransplant weight loss with  patient or graft survival. However, association studies cannot distinguish purposeful from unintentional weight loss as a result of illness and comorbidity. Prospective evaluations of the impact of targeted risk modification efforts in this population including dietary changes, monitored exercise programs, and bariatric surgery are urgently needed.;;Lentine KL, Delos Santos R, Axelrod D, Schnitzler MA, Brennan DC, Tuttle-Newhall JE;;eng;['Body Composition', '*Body Mass Index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/complications', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*complications/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation/economics/ethics', 'Obesity/*complications', '*Patient Selection/ethics', 'Risk Assessment/methods'];;;;10.1159/000345476

382;23202992;Article;2013;Human reproduction (Oxford, England);;Uterine transplantation--a real possibility? The Indianapolis consensus.;;A group of experts gathered in Indianapolis in December 2011 to address lingering concerns related to uterus transplantation (UTn). They represent a multi-national group of four research teams who have worked for over 15 years on bringing UTn to reality for patients. Presented here are a set of parameters that must be considered in order for UTn to become an acceptable procedure in the human setting. UTn has been proposed as a potential solution to absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI). Causes of AUFI include congenital uterine factors (i.e. absence or malformation) or acquired uterine factors (e.g. hysterectomy for uncontrollable hemorrhage) rendering a woman 'unconditionally infertile'. Current estimates are that in the USA, up to 7 million women with AUFI may be appropriate candidates for UTn. As a result of a first human attempt in 2000, investigators have responded with a plethora of publications demonstrating successful UTn attempts, including pregnancies, in various autogeneic, syngeneic and allogeneic  animal models. Before UTn can become an accepted procedure, it must satisfy defined criteria for any surgical innovation, i.e. research background, field strength and institutional stability. Equally important, UTn must satisfy accepted bioethical principles (respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice) and their application (informed consent, appropriate assessment of risk and benefit and fair selection of individuals). Furthermore, we believe that a defined number of transplants should not be exceeded worldwide  without a successful term delivery, to minimize proceeding in futility using current techniques. Even if UTns were to become relatively common, the following  research objectives should be continuously pursued: (i) additional pregnancies in a variety of large animal/primate models (to search for unanticipated consequences), (ii) continuous assessment of women diagnosed with AUFI regarding  UTn, (iii) continuous assessment using 'borrowed' psychological tools from transplant centers, adoption agencies and assisted reproductive technology centers with potential recipients and (iv) continuous careful ethical reflection, assessment and approval.;;Del Priore G, Saso S, Meslin EM, Tzakis A, Brannstrom M, Clarke A, Vianna R, Sawyer R, Smith JR;;eng;['Consensus', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*surgery', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/psychology', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/ethics/psychology', 'United States', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];;;;10.1093/humrep/des406

Currently, ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) is the only option for fertility preservation available to preadolescent females. Ovarian tissue can be harvested for cryopreservation laparoscopically without delaying cancer treatment. Although OTC is an experimental and rapidly evolving area of research, it has shown success in humans, with several live births reported thus far. Therefore, an analysis of OTC and its suitability for preadolescent females is appropriate at this time. Future research directions will allow OTC to transition from an experimental method with limited availability to a viable option for preadolescent cancer patients.

Supporters justify these systems on the basis that they are fair and  will encourage donor registration. This article reviews existing studies of public reactions to priority systems, as well as studies of the extent to which the moral principle of reciprocity affects decision making in organ donation. The role of reciprocity in the public discourse surrounding the enactment of priority systems in Singapore and Israel is described. One factor that seems to have been  relevant in these countries is the existence of a religious minority that is perceived as willing to take an organ but not to donate one. Although this perception may have fueled a resentment of perceived ""free-riders,"" concerns were raised about the social divisiveness of priority systems. In sum, people appear to be sensitive to the principle of reciprocity in the context of organ donation, but this sensitivity does not always translate into support for priority systems.

To this end, certain ""absolute exclusion criteria"" have been proposed to screen out candidates who will not sufficiently benefit from transplant. Some programs use elevated body mass index as such an exclusion  criterion, given that some studies have reported an association with increased risk of delayed graft function and acute rejection, longer hospitalization, and decreased overall graft survival. Upon further examination, however, elevated body mass index turns out to be a poor evaluative criterion for transplant candidates, as it is only variably associated with negative transplant outcomes.

As such, it is subject to both governmental and public scrutiny. It must follow the requirements of the federal legislation and regulations regarding ""equitable allocation of organs."" An ideal allocation system should balance the ethical concepts of equity, or fairness, and utility, or usefulness. The current kidney allocation system has been in place, with some  modifications over time, since the mid-1980s. It suffers from the changing demographics in ESRD, notably the aging of these groups, and in the growing length of the kidney waiting list. The current algorithm is thus imbalanced and requires reexamination. In particular, the system fails to match kidneys with long-projected function to recipients with long-projected lifespans, and vice versa. To improve the utility of kidney transplantation and lengthen the useful lifespan of these organs, a system that better matches kidneys and recipients is  necessary, and this will require the use of recipient age in those calculations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study  was approved by the local ethics committee; written informed consent was obtained. Between August 2009 and October 2010, 40 renal transplant recipients were prospectively included in this study and examined with a clinical 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imager. An echo-planar DT imaging sequence was performed  in coronal orientation by using five b values (0, 200, 400, 600, 800 sec/mm(2)) and 20 diffusion directions. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were determined for the cortex and medulla of the transplanted kidney. Relationships between FA, ADC, and allograft function, determined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were assessed by using Pearson correlation coefficient. ADC and FA were compared between patients  with good or moderate allograft function (group A; eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and patients with impaired function (group B; eGFR </= 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) by using a student t test. P < .05 indicated a statistically significant difference. RESULTS: Mean FA of the renal medulla and cortex was significantly higher in group A (0.39 +/- 0.06 and 0.17 +/- 0.4) compared with group B (0.27 +/- 0.05 and 0.14 +/- 0.03) (P < .001 and P = .009, respectively). Mean ADCs of renal cortex and medulla were significantly higher in group A than in group B (P = .007 and P  = .01, respectively). In group B, mean medullary FA was significantly lower in patients whose renal function did not recover (0.22 +/- 0.02) compared with those with stable allograft function at 6 months (0.29 +/- 0.05, P < .001). There was significant correlation between eGFR and medullary FA (r = 0.65, P < .001), cortical ADC (r = 0.43, P = .003), and medullary ADC (r = 0.35, P = .01). CONCLUSION: DT imaging is a promising noninvasive technique for functional assessment of renal allografts.

390;23169222;Article;2012;Transplantation;;Tobacco smoking and solid organ transplantation.;;"Smoking, both by donors and by recipients, has a major impact on outcomes after organ transplantation. Recipients of smokers' organs are at greater risk of death (lungs hazard ratio [HR], 1.36; heart HR, 1.8; and liver HR, 1.25), extended intensive care stays, and greater need for ventilation. Kidney function is significantly worse at 1 year after transplantation in recipients of grafts from  smokers compared with nonsmokers. Clinicians must balance the use of such higher-risk organs with the consequences on waiting list mortality if the donor pool is reduced further by exclusion of such donors. Smoking by kidney transplant recipients significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events (29.2% vs. 15.4%), renal fibrosis, rejection, and malignancy (HR, 2.56). Furthermore, liver  recipients who smoke have higher rates of hepatic artery thrombosis, biliary complications, and malignancy (13% vs. 2%). Heart recipients with a smoking history have increased risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis (21.2% vs. 12.3%), graft dysfunction, and loss after transplantation. Self-reporting of smoking is commonplace but unreliable, which limits its use as a tool for selection of transplant candidates. Despite effective counseling and pharmacotherapy, recidivism rates after transplantation remain high (10-40%). Transplant services need to be more proactive in educating and implementing effective smoking cessation strategies to reduce rates of recidivism and the posttransplantation complications associated with smoking. The adverse impact of  smoking by the recipient supports the requirement for a 6-month period of abstinence in lung recipients and cessation before other solid organs.";;Corbett C, Armstrong MJ, Neuberger J;;eng;['Counseling', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Heart Transplantation/ethics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*physiology', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*physiology', 'Lung Transplantation/ethics/*physiology', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation'];;;Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom;10.1097/TP.0b013e318263ad5b

In the context of chronic kidney diseases,  renal transplantation offers patients a better clinical outcome than other treatment options. However, the benefits of organ transplantation have not been maximized due to an inadequate supply of organs for transplantation. Despite the  establishment of elaborate legal rules for organs procurement, both on deceased and living donors in numerous countries, ethical concerns remain. Most of them are consequences of the strategies implemented or proposed to address the so-called organ shortage. The involvement of society in these complex problems is crucial as numerous questions emerge: could actual state of organ procurement change?

Such questions cannot be settled a priori by medical science, bioethics or philosophical reflection. As Radcliffe-Richards suggests, the determination of death has become a moral question, and therefore, now extends into the political  arena.

Those against, believe that an inadequate discrimination against women is being exerted on one hand by subjecting them to a complex, inefficient and dangerous procedure, and on the other, against embryos when many healthy ones are rejected because they are not compatible, or because of the dangers to the embryo, and also the psychological problems for the sick child as well as the donor.

The arguments are similar to those of the bioethical ones, but there are some particular arguments such as that the autonomy of parents must be respected; that it is a success of the common sense; that it is not an invasive process as it is considered; that it only involves blood donation not a solid organ; that the child that donates will feel accompanied by the saved one and he/she will feel the satisfaction of since having helped someone to live because  without this procedure, the baby child would probably not have been born. The arguments against are the discrimination women undergo when they are subjected to this procedure with potential risks for her, the embryos and children. IN CONCLUSION: a) the morality of <<saviour sibling>> medicine not has been debated  in the bioethics and biomedical community before its implementation b) in both communities the majority of authors consider it to be ethically licit; c) paradoxically there is a greater relative percentage of authors who are critical  of it within the biomedical field than in bioethics; d) from a personalist bioethics perspective a human embryo is endowed with the dignity of a person and  as such must be respected, this technique being an positive eugenics practice, in which, after previous selection health embryos are deprived of their right to exist.";;Arango Restrepo P, Sanchez Abad PJ, Pastor LM;;spa;['Abortion, Induced/ethics', 'Blastocyst', 'Blood Donors', 'Child Advocacy/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Embryo Disposition', 'Eugenics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Female', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/ethics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Personhood', 'Pregnancy', 'Preimplantation Diagnosis/*ethics', '*Siblings', 'Value of Life'];;;;

396;23114533;Article;2012;Transplantation;;Potential for deceased donation not optimally exploited: donor action data from six countries.;;BACKGROUND: Most countries today promote living donation as an alternative to challenge the organ shortage from deceased donors. This seems justifiable provided the potential for deceased donation is optimally exploited. METHODS: We  used the Donor Action (DA) Medical Record Review (MRR) methodology in six countries, to measure whether the potential for heart-beating (HB) deceased donors was adequately converted to donation. Medical record review data were collected from 52,383 patients who died in 605 critical care units in 227 hospitals between January 2007 and December 2009. RESULTS: On a total of 17,903 ventilated patients aged younger than 76 years and without contraindications to HB donation, 4,855 cases met criteria for brain death (BD) diagnosis and were considered potential HB donors. On average, 24.8+/-15.9% was not identified as potential donor, 21.9% of identified cases was not referred as such to a procurement team, and in 11.3% of identified cases, no approached was offered with the option to donate. Average consent rates/family approaches or registry consultation was 69.1+/-14.5%, and average conversion of potential into actual donors was 42.1+/-7.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Over 57% of deceased potential donors in the study cohort were missed along the donation pathway because of nonidentification, no referral, no approach of relatives, or objections to donate. In countries with lower donation rates, expectedly more potential donors are missed proportionally. Efforts to increase the organ pool should therefore focus on optimizing clinical  practices in deceased organ donation in addition to promoting living organ donation.;;Roels L, Smits J, Cohen B;;eng;['Chi-Square Distribution', '*Donor Selection/ethics/trends', 'Europe', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Israel', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/trends', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*supply & distribution', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/trends'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e31826dde40

We investigated the effect  of an educational program targeting HA organ donation in places of worship. A prospective observational study was conducted at four Catholic churches with a high percentage of HA. A 45-min ""culturally sensitive"" educational program, conducted in Spanish, was implemented. Organ donation awareness, knowledge, perception, and beliefs, as well as the intent to become an organ donor, were measured before and after the intervention. Differences between before and after  the intervention were analyzed. A total of 182 surveys were conducted before and  159 surveys were conducted after the educational program. A significant increase  was observed in organ donation knowledge (54% vs. 70%, p<0.0001), perception (43% vs. 58%, p<0.0001), and beliefs (50% vs. 60%, p=0.0001). However, no significant  difference was found in the willingness to discuss donation with family, intent-to-donate, or registering to donate after the intervention. This study demonstrates that a focused educational program in places of worship can significantly improve HA knowledge, perceptions, and beliefs regarding organ donation.

399;23096112;Article;2012;The Journal of medicine and philosophy;;Consent and the use of the bodies of the dead.;;Gametes, tissue, and organs can be taken from the dying or dead for reproduction, transplantation, and research. Whole bodies as well as parts can be used for teaching anatomy. While these uses are diverse, they have an ethical consideration in common: the claims of the people whose bodies are used. Is some  use permissible only when people have consented to the use, actually wanted the use, would have wanted the use, not opposed the use, or what? The aim of this article is to make progress in answering these questions. Initially I assume knowledge of people's desires in order to test whether consent is directly required by their rights without worrying about mistaken uses against their wishes. I claim consent is not directly required by people's rights. If we know people wanted or would want a use, their rights permit the use, but if we know they wanted or would want not to be used, their rights do not permit the use. The knowledge assumption is then dropped and the question becomes how to decide what  to do when the wishes of rightholders are not known. I suggest working out what to do when wishes are known and then adjusting, on the basis of whatever evidence there is, for probability and strength of desire. There are other considerations  too, for instance about default rules. The key general comment here is that, in setting rules, the costs to rightholders in not getting what they want needs to be taken into account. The final section tries to show that, in setting these rules, mistaken uses are not to be taken as worse than mistaken failure to use.;;Wilkinson TM;;eng;['*Attitude to Death', '*Bioethics', '*Cadaver', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Intention', 'Morals', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1093/jmp/jhs041

Our focus is on the equity concerns raised by recent proposals that give younger adults in end-stage renal disease priority to more and better deceased donor kidneys. We begin with a description of four models: the current allocation method (""baseline proposal""), the two models offered by the Kidney Transplant Committee in February 2011: a pure +/-15 years age-matching model and a 20/80 proposal (http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/SharedContentDocuments/KidneyConceptDocument.PDF ), and a new model entitled Equal Opportunity supplemented by Fair Innings (EOFI) described by Ross et al. earlier this year. We then consider the requirement of the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) of 1984 that allocation policies balance efficiency and equity. The models all define efficiency as promoting graft and patient survival but use various conceptions of equity. We discuss the  various conceptions of equity employed in the various models. We show that only the new proposal, EOFI, can meet the NOTA requirements using a multiprincipled equity approach to kidney allocation.";;Ross LF, Thistlethwaite JR Jr;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cadaver', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1111/sdi.12016

One of the oldest binding documents in history, the text has remained the ethical template for physicians to this day. The changing cultural and social environment of modern society, accompanied by the advancement in scientific knowledge and therapeutic tools, has surfaced the need to reframe ethical perspective in modern medicine. Progress in aspects such as organ transplantation, stem cell technology, and genetic engineering has welcomed a new set of ethical dilemmas. These dilemmas have become intimately intertwined with the impact of commercialization, as seen by the interplay between legislation, health care, and pharmaceutical businesses. This paper seeks to dissect the principles of the original Hippocratic Oath and analyze the template in relation to the ethical dilemmas presented by contemporary medicine. Examination will provide a deeper understanding of the paradigm shift in modern medical ethics. Both the value of the Oath and the level of awareness of modern ethical dilemmas through the lens of American and Indian medical graduates will be assessed.";;Jhala CI, Jhala KN;;eng;['Clinical Medicine/*economics/*methods', '*Ethics, Clinical', '*Hippocratic Oath', 'Humans'];;;;10.4103/0377-4929.101730

This study sought to determine (1) the acceptability of  expense reimbursement or financial incentives by the general public, health professionals involved with organ donation and transplantation, and those with or affected by kidney disease and (2) for the public, whether financial incentives would alter their willingness to consider donation. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Web-based survey administered to members of the Canadian public, health professionals, and people with or affected by kidney disease asking questions regarding acceptability of strategies to increase living and deceased kidney donation and willingness to donate a kidney under various financial incentives. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 2004 members of the  Canadian public October 11-18, 2011; responses from health professionals (n=339)  and people with or affected by kidney disease (n=268) were collected during a 4-week period commencing October 11, 2011.

Support for monetary payment for living donors was 45%, 14%, and 27% for the public, health professionals, and people with or affected by kidney disease, respectively. Overall, reimbursement of funeral expenses for deceased donors and a tax break for living donors were the most acceptable.

Data, including attitudes about donation, attendance in an organ donation course, donation activity, self-reported knowledge of donor management, legislation, transplantation, and aftercare were collected from intensive care specialists (n=179) and nurses (n=103). RESULTS: An organ donation course was attended by 53.6% of physicians and 16.7% of nurses (p=0.000); the 59% of doctors and 64.7% of nurses who did not participate in education were not willing to do so. Older staff were more likely to attend the course (p<0.01). Organ donation activity was not influenced by age or type of staff (physician or nurse), but it  was higher among staff who attended training (p<0.01).

This paper addresses ethical issues underlying medical decision-making and counseling in the setting of emerging treatments, when long-term outcomes are still in the process  of being fully validated. We argue that the ethical transition of emerging technologies, ideally from ethically impermissible to permissible, to obligatory, depends primarily on two factors: outcome data (or prognosis) and treatment feasibility. To illustrate these points, we will use intestinal transplant for short bowel syndrome (SBS) as a specific example. After reviewing the data, this  paper will identify the ethical justifications for both comfort care only and intestinal transplant in patients with ultra SBS, and argue that both are ethically permissible, but neither is obligatory. The approach outlined will not  only be valuable as ultra SBS outcomes data continue to change, but will also be  applicable to other novel therapies as they emerge in perinatal medicine.;;Cummings CL, Mercurio MR;;eng;['Adult', 'Biomedical Technology/*ethics', 'Counseling', '*Decision Making', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Informed Consent', 'Intestine, Small/*transplantation', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Palliative Care', 'Parents', 'Prognosis', 'Short Bowel Syndrome/*surgery', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;;10.1038/jp.2012.69

It examines a key challenge to that objection, to the effect that denying poor people the option to sell an organ is to withhold from them the best that a bad situation has to offer. The article casts serious doubt on this attempt at justifying an organ market, and its philosophical underpinning. Drawing, in part, from the catalogued consequences of a thriving kidney market in some parts of India, it is argued that the justification relies on conditions which are extremely unlikely to obtain, even in a regulated donor market: that organ selling meaningfully improves the material situation of the organ vendor. Far from being axiomatic, both logic and the extant empirical evidence point towards the unlikelihood of such an upshot.

Quantitative  data were extracted, and a qualitative synthesis of the studies was conducted. Twenty studies involving 4254 respondents were included. We identified two goals  underpinning healthcare provider preferences for organ allocation: (i) maximize clinical benefit (quality of life gains, patient survival, treatment adherence, and graft survival) and social outcomes (social support, productivity, and valuation); (ii) achieve equity (waiting time, patient preferences, access to live donation, and medical urgency). Maximizing clinical or social outcomes meant organs would be preferentially given to patients expected to achieve good transplant outcomes or wider social gain. Achieving equity meant all patients should have an equal chance of transplant, or patients deemed more urgent receive higher priority. A tension between equity and efficiency is apparent. Balanced against dimensions of efficiency were considerations to instill a degree of perceived fairness in organ allocation. Ongoing engagement with stakeholders is needed to enhance transparency, a reasonable balance between efficiency and equity, and avoid discrimination against specific populations.";;Tong A, Jan S, Wong G, Craig JC, Irving M, Chadban S, Cass A, Howard K;;eng;['Age Factors', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics', 'Health Personnel/*ethics', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Patient Preference', 'Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', '*Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1111/ctr.12004

413;22974946;Article;2012;Transplantation proceedings;;Transplantation ethics: are we approaching the crossroads?;;"Ethical issues of organ transplantation are of extreme importance to involved physicians and to society. The basic principle is that the donor cannot be considered as a commodity; financial incentives must not occur. Regarding deceased-donor organ transplantations, ethical issues are related to the consent  for donation, determination of death, and principles of organ allocation. Living  donors should be healthy, giving free consent after being fully informed about the risks of the procedure. Transplant professionals have a double responsibility because they must remember about the rights of the organ recipient as well as of  the donor. Because of the organ shortage we commonly use organ recovery from donors after cardiac arrest and extend the living-donor pool, practices that may  influence some important ethical principles. A proper detailed determination of donor death is of utmost importance. The dead donor rule must be preserved. However category III non-heart-beating donors (so-called controlled cardiac arrest) raise doubts as to the time of the decision to transfer the dying (not yet dead) patient to the operating room to withhold supportive treatment. In certain centers, not quite healthy living donors are being used; they are called  extended-criteria or complex donors. Although organ trade is condemned, some workers agree to use as complete strangers donors, obviously believing in pure altruistic motivation of such donors without the additional incentives. Finally,  is the trend to consider utility in organ allocation justified? It seems that quite soon we may need a new transplantation ethics code that is not totally directed by transplant professionals exclusively to the needs of potential recipients.";;Rowinski W, Paczek L;;eng;['*Ethics', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Living Donors', '*Transplantation'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.07.111

The aim of the current study was to compare key indicators of transplantation primarily cold ischemic time [CIT], between time periods with outcomes. METHODS: The following indicators were systematically collected prospectively and retrospectively for each deceased heart-beating donor transplantation between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2010  (n = 114) versus January 1, 2011 and October 31, 2011 (n = 91): CIT for the first and second kidney; laboratory turnaround times (TAT), and time for final preparation of the selected recipient. RESULTS: As a result of the new procedure, the CIT for the first kidney decreased from 16.5 +/- 3.5 to 12.4 +/- 3.2 hours (P < .001). Similarly, for the second kidney the parameters were a 19.8 +/- 3.4 versus 16.0 +/- 3.8 hours (P < .001). As a consequence of more hands-on time in the laboratory, the TAT increased from 5.6 +/- 0.8 hours to 7.2 +/- 1.1 hours (TAT1) followed by an additional 4.2 +/- 1.0 hours (TAT2). We also compared the times necessary for preparation of immunologically suitable recipients for transplantation, namely, 9.5 +/- 2.3 hours in the earlier system, increasing to 15.5 +/- 4.3 hours during the new procedure. CONCLUSION: As a consequence of the  procedural change, the CIT parameter decreased significantly for both kidneys, which may have contributed to improved short-term outcomes of transplantation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: After a preclinical experience, we obtained permission from the Ethics Committee of our institution to transplant lungs after EVLP reconditioning. ABO compatibility, size match, and donor arterial oxygen pressure (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) </= 300 mm Hg were considered to be inclusion criteria, whereas the presence of chest trauma and lung contusion, evidence of gastric content aspiration, pneumonia, sepsis, or systemic disease were exclusion criteria. We only considered subjects on an extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) bridge to transplantation with rapid functional deterioration. Using Steen solution with packed red blood cells oxygenated with 21% O(2), 5% to 7% CO(2) was delivered, targeted with a blood flow of approximately 40% predicted cardiac output. Once normothermic, the lungs were ventilated with a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg a PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O and a respiratory rate of 7 bpm. Lungs were considered to be suitable for transplantation if well oxygenated [P(v-a) O(2) > 350 mm Hg on FiO(2) 100%], in the absence of deterioration of pulmonary vascular resistance and lung mechanics over the perfusion time. RESULTS: From March to September 2011, six lung transplantations  were performed, including two with EVLP. The functional outcomes were similar between groups: at T72 posttransplantation, the median PaO(2)/FiO(2) were 306 mm  Hg (range, 282 to 331 mm Hg) and 323 mm Hg (range, 270 to 396 mm Hg) (P = 1, EVLP versus conventional). Intensive care unit ICU and hospital length of stay were similar (P = .533 and P = .663, respectively) with no mortality at 60 days in both groups. EVLP donors were older (49 +/- 6 y versus 21 +/- 7 y, P < .05), less well oxygenated (184 +/- 6 mm Hg versus 570 +/- 30, P < .05), displaying higher Oto scores (9.5 +/- 0.7 versus 1.7 +/- 1.5, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The first 6 months of the EVLP program allowed us to increase the number of organs available  for transplantation with short-term outcomes comparable to conventional transplantations.;;Valenza F, Rosso L, Gatti S, Coppola S, Froio S, Colombo J, Dossi R, Pizzocri M, Salice V, Nosotti M, Reggiani P, Tosi D, Palleschi A, Pappalettera M, Ferrero S, Perazzoli A, Costantini D, Scalamogna M, Rossi G, Colombo C, Santambrogio L, Gattinoni L;;eng;['Adult', '*Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung/*physiology', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Function Tests', '*Tissue Donors'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.06.023
417;22974843;Article;2012;Transplantation proceedings;;Kidney allocation for transplantation: some aspects of ethics and comparative law.;;The allocation of organs is a crucial ethical issue. The importance attached to different allocation criteria differs considerably among the various national and international organizations. The balance between justice-centered and utility-centered systems is shifting and there are signs of a possible swing away from systems centered mainly on waiting times to others centered mainly on criteria of utility. This evolution is very significant and seems to run counter  to the main stream of modern bioethics. Examples from different national policies are given herein. Particular attention is given to Europe, where national bioethics committees have tended to ignore the aspect of organ allocation. By overemphasizing the issues related to informed consent, the ethical challenges arising from the problems of resource allocation are often relegated to second place.;;Petrini C;;eng;['*Ethics', '*Health Care Rationing', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.05.059

Although short-term outcomes are similar in older versus younger transplant recipients, older donor or recipient age is associated with inferior long-term outcomes. However, age is often a proxy for other factors that might predict poor outcomes more strongly and better identify patients at risk for adverse events. Approaches to transplantation in older adults vary across programs, but despite recent gains in access and the increased use of marginal organs, older patients remain less likely than other groups to receive a transplant, and those who do are highly selected. Moreover, few studies have addressed geriatric issues in transplant patient selection or management, or the  implications on health span and disability when patients age to late life with a  transplanted organ. This paper summarizes a recent trans-disciplinary workshop held by ASP, in collaboration with NHLBI, NIA, NIAID, NIDDK and AGS, to address issues related to kidney, liver, lung, or heart transplantation in older adults and to propose a research agenda in these areas.;;Abecassis M, Bridges ND, Clancy CJ, Dew MA, Eldadah B, Englesbe MJ, Flessner MF, Frank JC, Friedewald J, Gill J, Gries C, Halter JB, Hartmann EL, Hazzard WR, Horne FM, Hosenpud J, Jacobson P, Kasiske BL, Lake J, Loomba R, Malani PN, Moore TM, Murray A, Nguyen MH, Powe NR, Reese PP, Reynolds H, Samaniego MD, Schmader KE, Segev DL, Shah AS, Singer LG, Sosa JA, Stewart ZA, Tan JC, Williams WW, Zaas DW, High KP;;eng;['Aged', 'Health Care Rationing', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Selection', 'Social Justice', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;1 U13 AG040938-01/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04245.x

We provide an ethical analysis of the new law. RECENT FINDINGS: We note that by continuing to require opt-in consent, the Israeli law has an ethical advantage over opt-out laws, which may result in some use of organs from donors who have not consented.  We discuss the fair response to 'free-riding' candidates who, usually for religious reasons, are opposed to donation, but nevertheless seek a transplant, who will not receive any priority over candidates who have been registered donors for at least 3 years before listing. We spell out several reasons why it is potentially unfair to prioritize patients whose first-degree relatives are registered donors, whereas it is fair to prioritize candidates who have been living directed or nondirected donors. Finally, we note the difficulty of ensuring public awareness of the priority system, which is necessary for its fairness.

426;22875978;Article;2012;Journal of medical ethics;;Licenced to transplant: UK overkill on EU Organ Directive provides golden opportunity for research.;;Progress in transplantation outcomes depends on continuing research into both donor and recipient factors that may enhance graft and patient survival. A system of licencing for transplantation research, introduced by the Human Tissue Act 2004, which separates it from the transplantation process (then exempt from licencing), has damaged this vital activity by a combination of inflexible interpretation of the 2004 Act and fear of criminal liability on the part of researchers. Now, following the European Union (EU) Directive (2010) on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation, new UK Regulations have been drafted, which are intended to implement it. These Regulations impose a compulsory licencing system, similar to that for research, on the whole transplantation process. This goes beyond what is required by the Directive and may even have an inhibitory effect similar to that already seen in  research. Initial draft Regulations went further, imposing criminal sanctions for breaches. However, following a public consultation process, the Department of Health (DH) has recently stated that, as a result of the overwhelming view of respondents that the proposed licencing system was unnecessary, all sanctions under the final Regulations are now decriminalised, with the sole exception of operating without a licence. While this does not eliminate the negative effect of licencing, it does suggest an awareness of the DH that excessive regulation unnecessarily harms the transplantation process. An opportunity thus arises for the Human Tissue Authority (the regulatory body for both the new licences and research licences under the 2004 Act) to end the current illogical and harmful separation of transplantation and transplantation research by ensuring that all centres licenced for organ donation, retrieval and transplantation are also fully licenced for related research.;;Cronin AJ, Douglas J, Sacks S;;eng;"['European Union', '*Government Regulation', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', '*Licensure, Hospital/standards/trends', 'Organ Transplantation/*legislation & jurisprudence', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards/trends"", 'Research/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United Kingdom']";;;MR/J006742/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1136/medethics-2012-100872

428;22854424;Article;2012;Transplantation;;Organ donation and Islam-challenges and opportunities.;;The issue of organ donation in Islam has been debated for decades, with most religious authorities sanctioning both living-organ and deceased-organ donation.  However, disquiet among the Islamic community on the compatibility of organ donation with their faith remains, especially in relation to deceased-organ donation. This remains a topical, controversial, and challenging component of organ procurement at both local and international levels. In this article, I will explore Islamic arguments both for and against organ donation, in the context of  both living-donor and deceased-donor models. By discussing both practical and philosophical perspectives, the aim is to facilitate discussion on how best to achieve consensus on this issue by driving the debate forward in an open and all-encompassing manner. Although every attempt should be made to achieve consensus among key Muslim opinion makers (individuals, authorities, and institutions), encouraging personalized decision making by intellectual effort should be the goal to achieve genuine informed consent.;;Sharif A;;eng;['Choice Behavior', '*Cultural Characteristics', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Islam', 'Living Donors', 'Morals', '*Religion and Medicine', '*Tissue Donors/ethics/supply & distribution', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e31825f4474

This study was performed on 80 patients who were randomly allocated to group D (desflurane, n = 40) or group I (isoflurane, n = 40) after Faculty Ethics Committee approval. After induction, isoflurane or desflurane was used with air/oxygen for anesthetic maintenance. The isoflurane or desflurane concentration was set at one minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). Remifentanil was infused for analgesia as well as cisatracurium. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),  international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, platelet count, and hemoglobin levels were analyzed preoperatively at end of the operation, and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 30. Both AST and ALT differed significantly and continually except on POD 30. AST showed significant elevations from the end of the operation to POD 2  and ALT, from the end of the operation to POD 5 in group I compared with group D. INR was significantly higher from the end of the operation to POD 3 in group I and to POD 2 in group D. At the end of the operation as well as on POD 1 and POD  2, INR was significantly increased in group I compared with group D. Albumin level was significantly lower at the end of the operation in both groups, but it  was not different. No patient developed hepatic or renal failure.

We show that by moving the conversation from paternalism, negative autonomy, and informed consent to moral agency, relational autonomy, and shared decision making, one better understands why the arguments given by Testa and colleagues fail.

It is appropriate that strict regulations to govern an individual's decision to donate have been developed. Some may argue that adherence to such regulations creates a doctor-patient relationship that is rooted in paternalism, which is in drastic contrast with a doctor-patient relationship that is rooted in patients' autonomy, characteristic of most other operative interventions. In this article we analyze the similarities between cosmetic plastic surgery and living donor surgery as examples of surgeries governed by different ethical principles. It is interesting that, while the prevailing ethical approach in living donor surgery is based on paternalism, the  ethical principle guiding cosmetic surgery is respect for patients' autonomy. The purpose of this article is not to criticize either practice, but to suggest that, given the similarities between the two procedures, both operative interventions should be guided by the same ethical principle: a respect for patients' autonomy. We further suggest that if living organ donation valued donors' autonomy as much  as cosmetic plastic surgery does, we might witness a wider acceptance of and increase in living organ donation.;;Testa G, Carlisle E, Simmerling M, Angelos P;;eng;['*Coercion', 'Decision Making', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', '*Living Donors', '*Moral Obligations', 'Odds Ratio', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Paternalism', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics', 'Risk', 'Surgery, Plastic/*ethics', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;

Muslim jurists allowed different forms of bone grafts (autograft, allograft and xenograft) for widely broken bones. Ibn Sina in 1037 discussed this subject in Al-Kanoon 1000 years ago. In 1959, the Muftis of Egypt  and Tunisia allowed, under specific conditions, corneal transplants from dead persons. Thereafter, many fatwas (jurisprudence) on organ trans-plantation have been issued from different parts of the Muslim world. In Amman, Jordan, the International Islamic Jurist Council recognized brain-death as a recognized sign  of death in Islam in October 1986. This paved the way for organ transplantation from brain-dead persons, which started immediately in Saudi Arabia. In 1990 and 2003, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy (IIFA) and the Islamic Fiqh Academy  (IFA) issued important fatwas on organ transplantation. By the end of 2008, more  than 3600 organs were transplanted from brain-dead persons in Saudi Arabia.;;Albar M;;eng;['Humans', '*Islam', 'Living Donors', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Religion and Medicine'];;;;10.4103/1319-2442.98169

Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is  not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end-stage kidney disease include the economic limitations that in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation and vaccination. Even in high-income countries, the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited medical, surgical and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have  solutions that involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental and political environments.

I argue that not even principled anti-paternalists need to reject such bans. This is because their rationale is not hard paternalism, which anti-paternalists repudiate, but soft paternalism, which they in principle accept. More precisely, I suggest that  their rationale is what Franklin Miller and Alan Wertheimer call 'group soft paternalism'. Group soft paternalistic policies restrict the freedom of autonomous individuals, not for their own good (hard paternalism), but as an unavoidable consequence of seeking to protect other, non-autonomous individuals from harms that they have not voluntarily chosen (soft paternalism). Group soft paternalism supports prohibiting kidney sales on three conditions: (1) that such  sales are potentially harmful to vendors, (2) that many vendors would suffer impaired autonomy, and (3) that distinguishing between autonomous and non-autonomous vendors and interfering only with the latter is unfeasible.

As the demand for organ transplantation far exceeds the organ availability, the transplant program is often saddled with complex legal and ethical issues. This review article highlights the legal and ethical issues that might arise regarding organ transplantation and appraises the existing legal frame work governing organ transplantation in Nigeria. Information on legal, cultural, religious and medical ethical issues regarding organ transplantation in Nigeria was obtained by searching the PubMed and Google Scholar, conference proceedings, seminar paper presentations, law library and other related publications were collated and analyzed. In decision making for organ transplantation, the bioethical principles like autonomy, beneficence and justice must be employed. It was believed by Catholic theologians that to mutilate one living person to benefit another violates the principle of Totality. Among Muslim scholars and researchers, there  are those who throw legal support as to its permissibility while the other group  sees it as illegal. Organ/tissues transplantation is considered a medical intervention that touches on the fundamental rights of the donor or the recipient. Where there is an unlawful infringement of the right of such persons in any way may be regarded as against Section 34 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution dealing with right to dignity of the human person. Worldwide, the researchers and government bodies have agreed on informed consent for organ/tissue donation and for recipient should be obtained without coercion before embarking on such medical treatment Worldwide organ transplantation has become the best medical treatment for patients with end stage organ failure. However, there is no law/legislation backing organ/tissues transplantation in Nigeria. The government should take measures to combat transplantation tourism and the problem of national and international trafficking in human tissues and organs, ethics commission and National Transplant registry should be established  in order to monitor and regulate the programme in the country.";;Bakari AA, Abbo Jimeta US, Abubakar MA, Alhassan SU, Nwankwo EA;;eng;;['Ethical', 'Islamic perspective', 'Nigeria', 'legal', 'organ transplantation'];;;10.4103/1117-6806.103103

An ongoing issue is that there remains considerable variation between countries (and programs within a country) in evaluation and in acceptance criteria. A major problem for most countries is the shortage of organs. As a consequence, illegal or quasi-legal unregulated markets have developed in some areas.

Many have argued that paying for donation leads to coercion and exploitation of the poor, and, in the end, produces more harm than good. Others have said that payment helps the poor, and we should all have sovereignty over our bodies and, thus, should be allowed to donate for remuneration. Although World Health Organizations and governments in many countries have now banned the process of paying for donation, there is still ongoing payment legally and illegally.

National registries around the world and several separate registries in the United States arrange paired donations, although with significant variations in their practices. Concerns about ethical considerations, clinical advisability, and the quantitative effectiveness of these approaches in  paired donation result in these variations. For instance, although donor travel can be burdensome and might discourage paired donation, it was nearly universal until convincing analysis showed that living donor kidneys can sustain many hours of cold ischemia time without adverse consequences. Opinions also differ about whether the last donor in a chain of paired donation transplants initiated by a nondirected donor should donate immediately to someone on the deceased donor wait-list (a domino or closed chain) or should be asked to wait some length of time and donate to start another sequence of paired donations later (an open chain); some argue that asking the donor to donate later may be coercive, and others focus on balancing the probability that the waiting donor withdraws versus the number of additional transplants if the chain can be continued. Other controversies in paired donation include simultaneous versus nonsimultaneous donor operations, whether to enroll compatible pairs, and interactions with desensitization protocols.

The author argues that the preferential option for the poor, a theological category, can provide the grounding for an inductive moral epistemology adequate for reforming the use  of culturally Western bioethical language. He proposes that the traditional, Western concept of bioethical coercion ought to be modified and expanded because  the conditions of the market system, as viewed from the perspective of organ vendors systemically deprived of access to sufficient resources, are sufficiently exploitative as to diminish the possibility of these vendors giving informed consent. Moreover, empirical studies conducted by professionals in medicine, sociology, psychiatry, economics, and medical anthropology continue to contribute support to the growing interdisciplinary consensus that functionally coercive structural factors exert the most significant influence upon a vendor's decision  to sell an organ within any market, regardless of legality or degree of regulation. Therefore any proposal to legalize and regulate the organ market remains patently unethical because doing so would likely function to constrain further the agency of poor potential vendors.;;Jaycox MP;;eng;['*Coercion', '*Commerce/ethics/trends', 'Consensus', '*Developing Countries', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Medical Tourism', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Poverty', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/standards/trends', 'United States'];;;;10.1111/j.1471-8847.2012.00327.x

451;22673884;Article;2012;Kidney international;;The Iranian model of living renal transplantation.;;Organ shortage for transplantation remains a worldwide serious problem for kidney patients with end-stage renal failure, and several countries have tried different models to address this issue. Iran has 20 years of experience with one such model that involves the active role of the government and charity foundations. Patients with a desperate demand for a kidney have given rise to a black market of brokers and other forms of organ commercialism only accessible to those with sufficient financial resources. The current Iranian model has enabled most of the Iranian kidney transplant candidates, irrespective of socioeconomic class, to have access to kidney transplantation. The Iranian government has committed a large budget through funding hospital and staff at the Ministry of Health and Medical Education by supporting the brain death donation (BDD) program or redirecting part of the budget of living unrelated renal donation (LURD) to the BDD program.  It has been shown that it did not prevent the development and progression of a BDD program. However, the LURD program is characterized by several controversial  procedures (e.g., confrontation of donor and recipient at the end of the evaluation procedure along with some financial interactions) that should be ethically reviewed. Operational weaknesses such as the lack of a registration system and long-term follow-up of the donors are identified as the 'Achilles heel of the model'.;;Mahdavi-Mazdeh M;;eng;['Financing, Government', 'Government Regulation', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility/economics/ethics/history/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration', 'Healthcare Disparities/ethics/history/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Insurance Coverage/organization & administration', 'Insurance, Health/organization & administration', 'Iran', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/history/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation/economics/history/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Living Donors/history/legislation & jurisprudence/*supply & distribution', '*Models, Organizational', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/history/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration'];;;;10.1038/ki.2012.219

Furthermore, many potential DCD donors fail to progress to asystole in a manner that would enable safe organ transplantation and no organs are recovered.  DCD protocols are based upon the principle that the donor must be declared dead prior to organ recovery. A new protocol is proposed whereby after a donor family  agrees to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments, premortem nephrectomy is performed in advance of end-of-life management. Since nephrectomy should not cause the donor's death, this approach satisfies the dead donor rule. The donor family's wishes are best met by organ donation, successful outcomes for the recipients, and a dignified death for the deceased. This proposal improves the likelihood of achieving these objectives.;;Morrissey PE;;eng;['Accidents, Occupational', 'Adult', '*Brain Injuries/etiology/surgery', 'Decompressive Craniectomy', '*Family', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, U.S., Health and Medicine Division', 'Nephrectomy/*ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', '*Public Opinion', '*Respiration, Artificial', 'Terminal Care/*ethics', '*Third-Party Consent/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics/methods', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/trends', '*Trust', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Withholding Treatment/*ethics'];;;;10.1080/15265161.2012.671886

462;22624597;Article;2012;BMC medical ethics;;One and done? Equality of opportunity and repeated access to scarce, indivisible  medical resources.;;BACKGROUND: Existing ethical guidelines recommend that, all else equal, past receipt of a medical resource (e.g. a scarce organ) should not be considered in current allocation decisions (e.g. a repeat transplantation). DISCUSSION: One stated reason for this ethical consensus is that formal theories of ethics and justice do not persuasively accept or reject repeated access to the same medical  resources. Another is that restricting attention to past receipt of a particular  medical resource seems arbitrary: why couldn't one just as well, it is argued, consider receipt of other goods such as income or education? In consequence, simple allocation by lottery or first-come-first-served without consideration of  any past receipt is thought to best afford equal opportunity, conditional on equal medical need.There are three issues with this view that need to be addressed. First, public views and patient preferences are less ambiguous than formal theories of ethics. Empirical work shows strong preferences for fairness in health care that have not been taken into account: repeated access to resources has been perceived as unfair. Second, while difficult to consider receipt of many other prior resources including non-medical resources, this should not be used a motive for ignoring the receipt of any and all goods including the focal resource in question. Third, when all claimants to a scarce resource are equally deserving, then use of random allocation seems warranted. However, the converse is not true: mere use of a randomizer does not by itself make the merits of all claimants equal. SUMMARY: My conclusion is that not ignoring prior receipt of the same medical resource, and prioritizing those who have not previously had access to the medical resource in question, may be perceived as fairer and more equitable by society.;;Huesch MD;;eng;['Guidelines as Topic', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics', 'Health Resources/*supply & distribution', '*Health Services Needs and Demand/ethics', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Reoperation/ethics', 'Social Justice/*ethics', 'United States'];;;;10.1186/1472-6939-13-11

However, its continued success is greatly limited by the shortage of donor organs. This has led to an increased focus within the critical care community on optimal identification and management of the potential organ donor.  The multi-organ donor can represent one of the most complex intensive care patients, with numerous competing physiological priorities. However, appropriate  management of the donor not only increases the number of organs that can be successfully donated but has long-term implications for the outcomes of multiple  recipients. This review outlines current understandings of the physiological derangements seen in the organ donor and evaluates the available evidence for management strategies designed to optimize donation potential and organ recovery. Finally, emerging management strategies for the potential donor are discussed within the current ethical and legal frameworks permitting donation after both brain and circulatory death.;;Dare AJ, Bartlett AS, Fraser JF;;eng;['Animals', 'Brain Death/*physiopathology', '*Critical Care', 'Ethics, Clinical', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1007/s11910-012-0272-9

Yet living donation challenges  the ethical principle of nonmaleficence by subjecting healthy individuals to medical, psychosocial and unknown risks. Therefore, transplant providers, policy-makers and donors are committed to ensuring that prospective donors provide adequate informed consent to undergo the procedure. Informed consent for  living donation is ethically required as a means of demonstrating respect for donor's autonomy and protecting their safety. However, all elements of informed consent are fraught with difficulties due to the unique nature of the donation process and outcome. This paper reviews empirical research on informed consent for live kidney donors (LKD) and live liver donors (LLD) for both adult and pediatric recipients. As this review shows, studies that empirically assessed the quality of informed consent elements reveal considerable variability and deficiencies across the informed consent process, suggesting the need for improvement. This review highlights challenges to each element of consent for both LKDs and LLDs, and situates trends within broader policy contexts, ethical debates and avenues for future innovative research.;;Gordon EJ;;eng;['Altruism', 'Decision Making', 'Empirical Research', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', '*Living Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04102.x
466;22594553;Article;2012;American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons;;Transplant tourism or international transplant medicine? A case for making the distinction.;;Transplant tourism is routinely denounced by influential voices such as the World Health Organization, the Declaration of Istanbul and the Madrid Resolution as an  unethical solution to worldwide organ shortages. Instead, it is suggested that national deceased donor schemes and multinational organ-sharing programs are the  only acceptable avenues for addressing the organ shortage crisis. The present demand for self-sufficiency in organ supply responds to risks such as poor clinical outcomes, and exploitation of the poor through the various commercial practices of transplant tourism. However, opponents of transplant tourism say little about what governments should do to ensure that their citizens have real and comprehensive access to all forms of transplantation. To address this complex question, we describe a current practice of international transplant medicine in  Singapore. It addresses salient concerns with transplant tourism and supports the principle of national self-sufficiency in organ supply, even as its health care system thrives and expands comprehensive transplant services to its citizens by catering to international patients. We offer a critical appraisal of the Singaporean system, and some suggestions to minimize the risk of abuse by international patients or operatives of illegal organ markets.;;Chin JJ, Campbell AV;;eng;['Humans', 'Internationality', '*Medical Tourism', '*Transplantation'];;;;10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04099.x

Controlled donation after cardiac death and premortem organ-preserving measures.;;The goal of this overview is to discuss the ethics of premortem organ-protective  measures with the aim of improving donation outcome for the recipient. A literature review was undertaken to find out which such measures were implemented in published articles on controlled donation after cardiac death. We reviewed studies on controlled human organ donation after cardiac death that were published in PUBMED and EMBASE between 2000 and 2010. To fit the inclusion criteria, studies had to describe the procedures that took place before the donor's death. We found 35 studies that were undertaken in six countries. Twenty-one of these studies mentioned the use of premortem measures on the donor  that had the aim to improve the outcome of donation for the recipient. These measures illustrated a wide spectrum of invasiveness. The authors conclude that premortem measures have the potential to instrumentalize the organ donor and that they should be restricted to cases in which the donor wish is known-directly, through a donor card, or through a surrogate decision maker-and specific consent  to premortem procedures has been given. This specific consent should be required  at least until the general public is aware that premortem measures may be performed. If potential donors were informed about premortem measures as part of  a community information effort, for example, school curricula, and again when they signed their donor card, one might consider their consent to be truly informed and valid.;;Bastami S, Krones T, Biller-Andorno N;;eng;['*Death', 'Humans', '*Organ Preservation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e31824836fa

METHODS: In the present study, the data of 207 patients from 2004 to 2011 were reviewed. The pre-, intra- and post-operative factors were statistically analyzed. All transplantations were approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Patients with definitely preoperative infections and infections within 48 h after transplantation were excluded from current study. All potential risk factors were analyzed using univariate analyses. Factors significant at a P < 0.10 in the univariate analyses were involved in the multivariate analyses. The diagnostic accuracy of the identified  risk factors was evaluated using receiver operating curve. RESULTS: The serious bacterial and fungal infection rates were 14.01% and 4.35% respectively. Enterococcus faecium was the predominant bacterial pathogen, whereas Candida albicans was the most common fungal pathogen. Lung was the most common infection  site for both bacterial and fungal infections. Recipient age older than 45 years, preoperative hyponatremia, intensive care unit stay longer than 9 d, postoperative bile leak and severe hyperglycemia were independent risk factors for postoperative bacterial infection.

472;22499492;Article;2012;The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York;;Living donor liver transplantation: ethical considerations.;;Most solid-organ transplants performed in the Western world are from deceased donors. In the last decade, deceased donation rates have reached a plateau as the number of patients with end-stage organ disease has steadily increased, resulting in a large discrepancy between organ supply and demand. Living donor transplantation is one way to decrease this discrepancy. However, living donation is not universally accepted. For instance, living donation rates vary geographically (eg, living donation is more accepted in Asia than in the Western  world) and depend on the organ donated (eg, kidney versus liver donation). In this article we will review the ethical principles guiding living donor liver transplantation, with emphasis on justification and safeguards that support the practice of adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation, the most clinically and ethically challenging type of living organ donation. Our ethical justification will include a presentation of triangular or tripartite equipoise,  a framework that aims to balance donor safety, expected recipient outcomes, and need.;;Miller CM, Smith ML, Diago Uso T;;eng;['Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Middle Aged', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1002/msj.21299

476;22471995;Article;2012;Internal medicine journal;;Explaining failure through success: a critical analysis of reduction in road and  stroke deaths as an explanation for Australia's low deceased organ donation rates.;;BACKGROUND/AIM: During the past two decades, Australian federal and state governments have funded many initiatives to bolster organ donation. Despite large investments of time, effort and money, Australia's deceased donation rate is in the bottom half of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and has only marginally increased from 11.9 donors per million people (pmp) in 1990 to 14.9 donors pmp in 2011. An often-cited explanation for this situation is that Australia's success in increasing levels of public health and safety through reduced traffic and stroke fatalities has reduced its number of potential deceased organ donors. We refer to this as the 'Failure Because of Success' hypothesis. Although commonly accepted, this hypothesis is largely untested. METHODS: By analysing data from international donation and transplantation organisations and international public health and safety organisations, we compared historical deceased organ donation rates with traffic  and stroke fatality rates in Australia and the seven countries with the world's highest deceased organ donation rates (Spain, Portugal, France, USA, Belgium, Austria and Italy). RESULTS: Traffic fatality rates across all countries in the study have fallen dramatically during the time period, with Spain having the lowest traffic fatality rates. Stroke fatality rates demonstrate similar reductions, with France showing the lowest cerebral vascular accident mortality rates. CONCLUSION: When compared with countries with the world's highest deceased donation rates, Australia's improvements to public health and safety through reductions in traffic and stroke fatalities were neither unique nor exemplary and do not provide an adequate explanation for its low organ donor rates.;;Bendorf A, Kerridge IH, Kelly PJ, Pussell B, Guasch X;;eng;['Accidents, Traffic/*mortality/*trends', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Developing Countries', 'Humans', 'Stroke/*mortality', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*trends'];;;;10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02792.x

An attempt to change this has led to the introduction of a pioneering  new law, the Organ Transplant Act 2008, which came into effect in January 2010 and sets out principles underlying a new policy in relation to the allocation of  organs for transplantation. According to this policy, a person can gain priority  points by signing a donor card, making a nondirected organ donation during their  lifetime, or as a result of a first-degree relative signing a donor card, or consenting to procurement of organs after death. In this opinion piece, we argue  that although this approach merits attention for its innovative aspects and its potential benefits, it raises some ethical difficulties. In particular, we discuss some problems of justice and fairness inherent in the system, focusing on inequalities because of the (a) number of relatives one might have, (b) the type  of living donation one makes, (c) the potential for strategic behavior, and (d) problems regarding the consent of family members.;;Quigley M, Wright L, Ravitsky V;;eng;['Ethical Analysis', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Living Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e31824e3d95

The objective of this article is to make an analysis through a survey carried out among French  surgeons. METHODS: A file of 909 e-mail addresses of surgeons was created so as to send out a questionnaire regarding 10 ethical issues. RESULTS: Beyond the technical prowess, the surgeons ethical reflection initially focused on the notion of consent to donation and care. They attached equal importance to all ethical questions. They spontaneously raised the issue of over-mediatization of these first transplants and the place of the transplant surgeons and their patients in the medical information. CONCLUSION: Over two thirds of the surgeons  attached importance to ethical issues regarding the donor and recipient of a facial allograft. Some of the principal questions facing facial transplantation is of an ethical nature as it is an unprecedented procedure that is challenged by the axiom to first do no harm and the need of modern medicine to limit risk to as close to zero as possible. For the non-specialist, accepting psychologically the  face of another individual appears to be a real issue. Contrary to that, the main demand expressed by the facial transplant recipients appears to be related to facial functions rather than appearance.;;Pirnay P, Foo R, Herve C, Meningaud JP;;eng;['Confidentiality/ethics', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Facial Transplantation/*ethics', 'France', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression/ethics', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Mass Media/ethics', 'Patient Rights/ethics', 'Personhood', 'Specialties, Surgical/*ethics', 'Tissue Donors/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics', 'Transplantation, Homologous/ethics/psychology'];;;;10.1016/j.jcms.2012.02.013

OBJECTIVE: The authors present a case series of adults with mental retardation or comparable acquired intellectual disability who underwent heart transplantation.  They discuss the literature on heart and kidney transplantation in people with mental retardation and the ethical reasoning that guides how recipients of solid  organ grafts are chosen. METHOD: Literature review and retrospective review of long-term outcomes for five adult patients with mental retardation or comparable  disability who received heart transplants. RESULTS: Among these cases, survival times to date ranged from 4 to 16 years, with a median survival of greater than 12 years. Medical non-adherence was a significant factor in only 1 of the 5 cases. In that case, the patient's medical non-adherence was due to a functional  decline in the primary caretaker. CONCLUSION: People with mental retardation can  receive long-term benefit from heart transplantation when they have the cognitive and social support necessary to ensure adherence to post-transplant regimens. There is no ethical or medical reason for guidelines to consider mental retardation, in and of itself, a contraindication to heart transplantation.

The concept of 'plasticity' is supported by old transplantation work, at least for embryonic cells, and metaplasia is a classic example of plasticity observed in patients. Nevertheless, the publication of a series of papers showing rare conversion of a  given cell type into another unrelated cell raised the possibility of using any unaffected tissue to create at will new cells to replace a different failing tissue or organ. This resulted in disingenuous interpretations and a reason not to fund anymore research on embryonic stem cells (ESc). Moreover, many papers on  plasticity were difficult to reproduce and thus questioned; raising issues about  plasticity as a technical artefact or a consequence of rare spontaneous cells fusion. More recently, reprogramming adult differentiated cells to a pluripotent  state (iPS) became possible, and later, one type of differentiated cell could be  directly reprogrammed into another (e.g. fibroblasts into neurons) without reverting to pluripotency.

Qualitative as well as quantitative data were generated through the donor-advocate consultation sessions and the written Living Donor Satisfaction Survey. Thirteen living donors participated. RESULTS: : No threats to donor rights were identified by either the donor or the advocate. Nonrelated donors were motivated by altruism, whereas related donors were motivated by a sense of family. A majority of donors reported being changed emotionally and spiritually by the act of serving as a living donor. The living kidney donors were overwhelmingly extremely satisfied with their decision to donate and perceived the living donor advocacy program as being very good.

Study results indicate while most patients would not agree to transplantation or brain donation for research, a proportion would agree. Among patients who declined organ donation for transplantation or brain research, almost half of family members would have agreed to brain donation for research and over 40% to organ transplantation.

We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the access to kidney transplantation on a cohort 2004-2008, using the national registry. Among the 14,732 patients registered during this period, 15.3% are of non-French nationality (3.4% other European, 5.9% North African, 3.9% sub-Saharan African, 2.9% other). Among the 84.6% of French nationality, 3.3% are living in French overseas territories. Compared to the 17.6-month median waiting time of the cohort, median waiting time differs significantly between groups, from 15.7 months for mainland French patients to 36 months for sub-Saharan African patients. Despite the regular development of the allocation rules, these disparities in access to transplantation are mainly, but not completely, explained by blood group or HLA matching difficulties. After adjustment for the other factors known to be significantly linked to a difficult access to transplantation, North and sub-Saharan African patients have the worst difficulties. Future research should consider nonmedical factors, such as socio-economic or socio-cultural factors, potentially relevant to avoid disparities in access to transplantation and should aim at developing specific interventions.;;Cantrelle C, Pessione F, Macher MA, Thuong M;;fre;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ethnic Groups', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Health Care Rationing/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/trends', 'Health Services Accessibility/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration/*trends', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Internationality', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/ethnology/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Residence Characteristics/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1007/s13149-012-0221-5

Significant facial disfigurement can preclude meaningful human interaction. Allotransplantation of facial tissues for reconstruction of devastating deformities has become a clinical reality, with 15 transplants performed at various centers around the world. Restoration of aesthetics and functionality has been superior to that achieved by conventional reconstruction,  without the morbidity of multiple surgeries. Unlike solid organ transplantation which can be life saving, facial transplantation is considered by many to be life enhancing, highlighting the ethical argument against justification of these procedures given the risks of lifelong immunosuppression. Meticulous patient selection is mandatory, and a multidisciplinary team approach is key for the program's success. The overriding goal of screening for candidacy is to identify  and select subjects who have the best chance for a positive immunologic, functional, and quality-of-life outcome.

499;22337420;Article;2012;The Journal of craniofacial surgery;;Face transplantation: outcomes, concerns, controversies, and future directions.;;BACKGROUND: Since 2005, 17 facial allotransplantations have been performed worldwide. The brief summary of current cases with ongoing concerns is presented  in this article. METHODS: Fifteen publications were reported for 10 facial allotransplantations. For the remaining 7 transplantations, information was gathered from scientific meeting presentations and media releases. The summary of current cases in terms of etiology, indications, results, complications, and outcomes are based on these data. The discussion of ongoing concerns, controversies, and overview of future implications is accomplished by reviewing the literature of ethical debates, experimental studies, clinical studies, and personal opinion. RESULTS: Two of the 17 face transplant recipients died. Overall survival rate was 88%. No early graft loss due to technical failure was reported. All reported cases that have more than 1-year follow-up had at least 1 acute rejection episode, which was reversible with treatment. Opportunistic infections  and metabolic complications were observed as adverse effects. Motor recoveries were slower than the sensorial recoveries, as expected. Functional and aesthetic  outcomes were satisfactory. Concerns and controversies about concomitant face and hand transplantation, recipient blindness, recipient age, primary reconstruction  option in facial trauma cases, funding, graft failure risks, and future treatment options are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Because of uncertainty about long-term outcomes, immunosuppression-related concerns and ethical debates limit worldwide  application of facial allotransplantation. However, in selected group of patients, it is a unique reconstruction method with promising outcomes. Further research and investigation in transplant immunology and treatment hold the key to advance this treatment option.;;Siemionow M, Ozturk C;;eng;['Esthetics', 'Facial Transplantation/ethics/*methods/physiology/trends', 'Forecasting', 'Graft Rejection/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression/adverse effects', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;;10.1097/SCS.0b013e318241b920

501;22337123;Article;2012;Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety;;Administrative complexities for a European observational study despite directives harmonising requirements.;;PURPOSE: For pharmacoepidemiological studies in Europe, accessing data should require only authorisation by the relevant data protections committees, as expected from the 1995 Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). Our experience from  a multinational observational study across seven European countries shows that this is certainly not the case. METHODS: The study was a multicentre, multinational, case-population study in European liver transplant centres in seven countries, retrospectively evaluating a 3-year period. Before data collection started, the procedures to obtain the necessary authorisations for the participating countries were defined. REMARKS: In France, a single opinion from a single data protection committee was enough to start the study. In Italy, Portugal, Greece and the UK, there was a national authority, but the hospitals requested the approval by their local committees/bodies irrespective of whether the authorisation of the national committee came after or before that of local ones. In Ireland, only one hospital participated, and the opinion of its ethics committee was sufficient. In the Netherlands, the opinion of the institutional review board of the local coordinating centre was necessary to obtain the opinions from the institutional review boards of the other hospitals. The information requested by the different committees and the time to obtain the approvals varied, even within the same country. CONCLUSION: This degree of complexity and disharmony, and resulting cost, was observed in a simple retrospective study. Regulators will need to be aware that these time-consuming,  expensive and useless complexities must be factored in when estimating the time and cost of a study.;;Gulmez SE, Lignot-Maleyran S, de Vries CS, Sturkenboom M, Micon S, Hamoud F, Blin P, Moore N;;eng;['Ethics Committees, Research/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration', '*European Union', 'Humans', '*International Cooperation', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1002/pds.3204

504;22306592;Article;2012;Current opinion in anaesthesiology;;Opt-in or opt-out for organ transplantation.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Opt-in or opt-out consent for organ transplantation is still a disputed subject and the determination of the more appropriate system is still debated. RECENT FINDINGS: Europe is still divided between countries where transplantation after brain death is governed by presumed consent and other where informed consent is mandatory. Recent debate, however, has emerged in each country to determine whether shifting systems might be beneficial for organ procurement. SUMMARY: Consent for organ donation in a brain dead patient represents an act of benevolence or of solidarity in favour of an unknown person. If one considers that the principle of autonomy must prevail over the principle of benevolence or of solidarity, the risk is depriving a potential recipient of a comparatively very important benefit. On the contrary, if one considers that the  principles of benevolence should necessarily lead, the risk is high of exerting an excessive pressure to the detriments of autonomy and liberty of the individual. Whatever the system chosen, adequate and fair communication expressing loyally the way families are approached is essential.;;Beloucif S;;eng;['Brain Death', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Personhood', 'Presumed Consent/ethics'];;;;10.1097/ACO.0b013e3283504c33

We argue that they are wrong, and  their mistake results from failing to appreciate how perceptions of meaning can influence people's responses to nudges. We favor a policy of default to donation  that is subject to immediate family veto power, includes options for people to opt out (and be educated on how to do so), and emphasizes the role of organ procurement organizations and in-house transplant donation coordinators creating  better environments for increasing the supply of organs and tissues obtained from cadavers. This policy will provide better opportunities for offering nudges in contexts where in-house coordinators work with families.

RECENT FINDINGS: A global consensus has been developed that active, significant mental illness and substance abuse are absolute contraindications to organ donation due to diminished ability to make a well informed, rational decision about donation or to maintain health status after donation. However, to date, there has been little information published on the suitability for donation and the long-term psychosocial and medical outcomes after donation in donors with mental health issues, especially relatively milder psychiatric disorders, or past significant psychiatric history.

A literature review and critical reflection.;;The majority of transplant centers around the world face an ethical debate whether to retransplant a young non-adherent patient. Non-adherence to lifelong immunosuppressants presents a significant risk for graft loss, yet rates remain consistently high. Despite a number of these patients presenting for retransplantation, there is little evidence to guide professionals in their decision-making. This paper aims to provide such guidance, by systematically reviewing the existing outcome data for retransplantation in patients who are known to be non-adherent to their immunosuppressants. This review searched for original papers that addressed retransplantation of a solid organ and included quantitative data on adherence or graft function. Only one original research paper was found to meet the inclusion criteria. This paper is reviewed, and details of the protocol to determine eligibility for retransplantation are summarized. The findings are discussed within the ethical context that transplant professionals work within, and the arguments for and against retransplantation are considered. The need for effective integration of adherence management into routine practice is highlighted, with an emphasis on reliable measurement of adherence throughout the patient's life.

This results in reduced mortality and disease among recipients compared with the use of kidneys from deceased donors. However, there are numerous ethical issues connected with the use of organs from living donors. This article aims to  examine how the relationship between recipients and known, living donors is affected by transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The article is based on a systematic literature search in MedLine. RESULTS: There is little research concerning the direct impact on the relationship between donor and recipient. Most donors report having an improved, or equally good relationship with recipients after transplantation. However, one study shows that when recipients receive a kidney from a parent during adolescence, conflicts frequently arise. The material also shows that good relationships have a tendency to improve, while poor or imbalanced relationships more often deteriorate following transplantation. INTERPRETATION: It is very important to survey the relationship  between a recipient and a potential donor before transplantation to avoid relational conflicts.;;Buer LC, Hofmann BM;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Family Conflict', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Quality of Life'];;;;10.4045/tidsskr.10.1403
518;22239842;Article;2012;Danish medical journal;;Good long-term survival after paediatric heart transplantation.;;INTRODUCTION: The brain-death criterion was introduced in Denmark in 1990. The first Danish paediatric heart transplantation (HTx) was performed at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen in 1991. We describe our experiences during the first 20 years with paediatric HTx. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  This was a retrospective study of 37 paediatric patients (<18 years) who were listed for HTx from 1991 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 26 of the 37 children listed underwent HTx, nine due to congenital heart disease (CHD) and 17 due to cardiomyopathy (CM). Ten patients died while being on the waiting list. One patient was withdrawn from the list due to spontaneous improvement. A total of 21 patients remain alive. Survival was 92% after five years and 82% after ten years. We had two early (CHD) and three late (CM) deaths. Complications were few, but significant. Early acute rejection occurred in seven patients, whereas one patient with repeated late episodes of acute rejection died from graft failure 5.5 years after HTx. We found a time-related progressive deterioration in renal function. Two patients underwent renal Tx, two others died while being on dialysis. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy occurred in three patients, two of whom  died. The third remains alive today, 19 years after HTx. CONCLUSION: Our paediatric HTx results are comparable with those of larger international centres  and consistent with true long-term survival. FUNDING: not relevant.

However, while the number who might benefit is relatively low, significantly fewer cadaveric donors exist for any given child compared with an adult. Incompatible organ size and relatively low donation rates mean that despite living parental donation and innovations to reduce donated organ size, children die before organs become available. The severity of the UK situation is compounded by restrictions on paediatric living donation, uncertainties over the application of brain death criteria, and ethical concerns  about the use of donation after circulatory death.

538;23461002;Article;2012;Duke law journal;;Custom, contract, and kidney exchange.;;"In this Essay, we examine a case in which the organizational and logistical demands of a novel form of organ exchange (the nonsimultaneous, extended, altruistic donor (NEAD) chain) do not map cleanly onto standard cultural schemas  for either market or gift exchange, resulting in sociological ambiguity and legal uncertainty. In some ways, a NEAD chain resembles a form of generalized exchange, an ancient and widespread instance of the norm of reciprocity that can be thought of simply as the obligation to ""pay it forward"" rather than the obligation to reciprocate directly with the original giver. At the same time, a NEAD chain resembles a string of promises and commitments to deliver something in exchange for some valuable consideration--that is, a series of contracts. Neither of these salient ""social imaginaries"" of exchange--gift giving or formal contract--perfectly meets the practical demands of the NEAD system. As a result,  neither contract nor generalized exchange drives the practice of NEAD chains. Rather, the majority of actual exchanges still resemble a simpler form of exchange: direct, simultaneous exchange between parties with no time delay or opportunity to back out. If NEAD chains are to reach their full promise for large-scale, nonsimultaneous organ transfer, legal uncertainties and sociological ambiguities must be finessed, both in the practices of the coordinating agencies  and in the minds of NEAD-chain participants. This might happen either through the further elaboration of gift-like language and practices, or through a creative use of the cultural form and motivational vocabulary, but not necessarily the legal and institutional machinery, of contract.";;Healy K, Krawiec KD;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Contracts/*legislation & jurisprudence', '*Culture', 'Donor Selection/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Gift Giving', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods', 'Living Donors/legislation & jurisprudence/*supply & distribution', '*Social Responsibility', 'Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration', 'Transplantation, Homologous/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods'];;;;

In the United States, media campaigns have been launched at local offices of the states' department of motor  vehicles to promote citizens' willingness to organ donation and donor registration. We analyze interventional studies of multimedia communication campaigns to encourage organ-donor registration at local offices of states' department of motor vehicles. The media campaigns include the use of multifaceted communication tools and provide training to desk clerks in the use of scripted messages for the purpose of optimizing enrollment in organ-donor registries. Scripted messages are communicated to customers through mass audiovisual entertainment media, print materials and interpersonal interaction at the offices of departments of motor vehicles. These campaigns give rise to three serious concerns: (1) bias in communicating information with scripted messages without verification of the scientific accuracy of information, (2) the provision of misinformation to future donors that may result in them suffering unintended consequences from consenting to medical procedures before death (e.g, organ preservation and suitability for transplantation), and (3) the unmanaged conflict of interests for organizations charged with implementing these campaigns, (i.e, dual advocacy for transplant recipients and donors). We conclude the following: (1) media campaigns about healthcare should communicate accurate information to the general public and disclose factual materials with the least amount of bias;  (2) conflicting interests in media campaigns should be managed with full public transparency; (3) media campaigns should disclose the practical implications of procurement as well as acknowledge the medical, legal, and religious controversies of determining death in organ donation; (4) organ-donor registration must satisfy the criteria of informed consent; (5) media campaigns should serve as a means of public education about organ donation and should not be a form of propaganda.";;Rady MY, McGregor JL, Verheijde JL;;eng;['Communication', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Death', 'Disclosure', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Marketing/ethics/*organization & administration', '*Mass Media', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*methods', 'United States'];;;;10.1007/s11019-011-9359-3

Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is the most common indication for DLT. When FAP patients are involved in DLT, the indications and outcomes are clear and good, although de novo FAP development within various periods of time has been described in DLT recipients of FAP livers. With the increasing need for organs, livers explanted from patients with rare metabolic diseases, such as primary hyperoxaluria (PH), acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFHC), are being used for DLT. However, insufficient data about the use of livers from patients with these rare metabolic diseases are available. In this review, we focus on the latter disorders. PH is not a good indication for DLT because recipients of PH livers develop hyperoxaluria and early acute renal failure. AIP also seems to be a debatable indication for DLT because of the rapid development of neurotoxicity in AIP liver recipients. However, the outcomes of DLT with HFHC and MSUD liver grafts (which include the risk of the de novo development of these genetic diseases) are promising. For rare metabolic liver diseases to be established as indications for DLT, more reports and studies are needed.;;Popescu I, Dima SO;;eng;['Hepatectomy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Liver/surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*methods', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Rare Diseases', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*methods'];;;;10.1002/lt.22443

Findings in this study derive from anthropological fieldwork lasting 36 months at three university hospitals in the Oslo-basin. 18 end stage kidney disease patients and their potential donors were recruited opportunistically and  interviewed (separately) in three or more semi-structured conversations during the evaluation process and after transplantation. 3 cases are discussed in detail. Notes were transcribed and analysed according to narrative theory. Focus  was to explore the content of donors' and recipients' pre- and post-transplantation narratives and to examine whether these accounts warrant a need for more comprehensive psychological assessment than is current practice in  Norway.

First communication in Mexico].;;BACKGROUND: Jehovah's Witness refuse blood transfusion, but they accept organ transplantation, albumin, immunoglobulin, vaccines and clotting factors. CLINICAL CASES: We present 3 kidney transplants in Jehovah's Witness patients (two male and one female) without blood transfusion, with a mean age of 31.33 years and a mean body mass index of 20.99 kg/m(2). All patients underwent pretransplant peritoneal dialysis for an average of 52.3 months. Two transplants came from living donors and one from a deceased donor with a cold ischemia of 23 hours. The donors were two females and one male, with a mean age of 34.33 years. All patients received pretransplant erythropoietin and iron dextran and an intraoperative cell saver was used. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells and serum creatinine levels, as well as the glomerular filtration at 24 months postransplant were stable. All patients received induction with basiliximab and initial immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors. One of the patients had a  perirenal hematoma as a complication, which required a surgery 20 days post-transplant. At 5, 26 and 36 months postransplant the three patients are alive and with functional grafts.

546;24475796;Article;2014;Radiology;;Living renal allograft transplantation: diffusion-weighted MR imaging in longitudinal follow-up of the donated and the remaining kidney.;;"PURPOSE: To determine whether diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in living renal allograft donation allows monitoring of potential changes in the nontransplanted remaining kidney of the donor because of unilateral nephrectomy and changes in the transplanted kidney before and after transplantation in donor and recipient, respectively, and whether DW MR parameters are correlated in the same kidney before and after transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee; written informed consent was obtained. Thirteen healthy kidney donors  and their corresponding recipients prospectively underwent DW MR imaging (multiple b values) in donors before donation and in donors and recipients at day 8 and months 3 and 12 after donation. Total apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCT) values were determined; contribution of microcirculation was quantified in perfusion fraction (FP). Longitudinal changes of diffusion parameters were compared (repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance with post hoc pairwise comparisons). Correlations were tested (linear regression). RESULTS: ADCT values  in nontransplanted kidney of donors increased from a preexplantation value of (188 +/- 9 [standard deviation]) to (202 +/- 11) x 10(-5) mm(2)/sec in medulla and from (199 +/- 11) to (210 +/- 13) x 10(-5) mm(2)/sec in cortex 1 week after donation (P < .004). Medullary, but not cortical, ADCT values stayed increased up to 1 year. ADCT values in allografts in recipients were stable. Compared with values obtained before transplantation in donors, the corticomedullary difference was reduced in allografts (P < .03). Cortical ADCT values correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate in recipients (R = 0.56, P < .001) but not donors. Cortical ADCT values in the same kidney before transplantation in donors  correlated with those in recipients on day 8 after transplantation (R = 0.77, P = .006). FP did not show significant changes. CONCLUSION: DW MR imaging depicts early adaptations in the remaining nontransplanted kidney of donors after nephrectomy. All diffusion parameters remained constant in allograft recipients after transplantation.

In this work we describe the types of donor exchange programs, from the two-way Kidney Paired Donation, where two incompatible donor-recipient couples exchange donors, to complex chains of transplants where the altruistic donation of a kidney (Living Non-direct Donor, or non-specific donation) is associated to a Kidney Paired Exchange Program (Domino Kidney Paired Donation, NEAD chains).

The major recommendations of the ethics committees were firstly, The WLST  decision is independent of the possibility of organ donation; secondly, the strict respect of ""The dead donor and organ transplantation rule"" and the updated national guidance for the WLST; thirdly, the drafting of a nationally agreed protocol defining the mandatory conditions to determine death and to perform procurement and transplantation. Organ donation after WLST will be authorised only in pilot centres with a locally agreed WLST policy including external second opinion and written transcript of the WLST decision, experienced intensive care staff, a local organ procurement coordination team familiar with DBD and DCD protocols and only in hospitals authorised for organ procurement.

Splanchnic hypoperfusion appears to play a key role in  the failure of functional recovery of the graft after orthotopic liver transplantation (LT). The aim of this study was to determine if alterations of tonometric parameters, which are related to splanchnic perfusion, could predict poor graft function in patients undergoing LT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After Ethics Committee approval, 68 patients undergoing LT were enrolled. In all the patients, regional-arterial CO2 gradient (Pr-aCO2) was recorded; in addition, the difference between Pr-aCO2 recorded at anhepatic phase (T1) and at the end of surgery (T2) (T2- T1 = DeltaPr-aCO2) was calculated. Poor graft function was determined on the basis of Toronto's classification 72 hours after LT. Student t-test and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical purpose. Results. DeltaPr-aCO2 was significantly greater in patients with poor graft function (3.5 +/- 13.2) compared to patients with good graft function (-5.8 +/- 12.3) (p = 0.014). The logistic regression analysis showed that the DeltaPr-aCO2  was able to predict the onset of poor graft function (p = 0.037). A value of DeltaPr-aCO2 >/= -4 was associated with poor graft function with a sensibility of 93.3% and a specificity of 42.3%. CONCLUSION. Our study suggests that the change  of Pr-aCO2 may be a valuable index of graft dysfunction.

554;24372808;Article;2014;Clinical transplantation;;Improving the potential for organ donation in an inner city Muslim American community: the impact of a religious educational intervention.;;OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the willingness of Muslim Americans to be potential organ donors, to describe potential religious barriers to organ donation, and to  evaluate the efficacy of a brief religious educational intervention. METHODS: Face-to-face survey with English-, Arabic-, and Urdu-speaking Muslim American adults in places of worship and gatherings. The two-part survey included questions about demographics and organ donation. A brief educational intervention followed, which included an explanation of organ donation, along with the evidence for Islam's support for organ donation. After this intervention, the questions about organ donation and brain death were repeated. RESULTS: The response rate was 81% (231 of 285). Fifty percent of the respondents would donate their organs. Twenty-five percent changed their opinion and accepted the idea of  being donors after the educational intervention. Lack of awareness of the support of Islam to organ donation and fear of disfigurement were the most common barriers cited. CONCLUSION: Muslim Americans are less likely than Caucasian Americans to be organ donors, and the perceived lack of support from Islam for organ donation is a factor. The effectiveness of our brief religious education intervention suggests that further education may improve organ donation rates among the Muslim community.;;Hafzalah M, Azzam R, Testa G, Hoehn KS;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Education', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Islam', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Perception', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors/*education', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States', 'Young Adult'];['Arab American', 'education', 'ethics', 'muslim', 'religion'];;;10.1111/ctr.12296

Twenty-one individuals were interviewed who had made a donation decision (13 refused corneal donation and eight consented). Analysis was performed using Grounded Theory. Refusal of corneal donation was related to concerns about disfigurement and the role of eyes in memory and communication. The request for donation therefore raised concerns about a potential adverse change in the ongoing relationship with the deceased, even in death. For those who refused donation, these concerns overshadowed awareness of need or benefit of transplantation.

563;24291238;Article;2014;Journal of hepatology;;Ethical considerations regarding early liver transplantation in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis not responding to medical therapy.;;A recent study proposed that liver transplantation may represent life-saving treatment in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis not responding to medical therapy. In this pilot experience, stringent patient selection resulted in major  improvement of short-term survival with low rates of post-transplant alcohol relapse. In the context of organ shortage, which imposes a need for strict selection of transplant candidates, these results raise major ethical questions.  Reluctance to perform liver transplantation in alcoholics is based on the fact that alcoholism is frequently considered to be self-inflicted and on fears of harmful post-transplant alcoholism recurrence. A minimal interval of sobriety lasting at least 6 months is a widely adopted criterion for the selection of patients with alcoholic liver disease for liver transplantation. In severe alcoholic hepatitis, the disastrous short-term prognosis in patients not responding to medical therapy does not allow one to reasonably impose an arbitrary period of 6-months of abstinence. This means that these patients must be either systematically excluded from transplantation or selected according to other criteria. Without significant pre-transplant abstinence, it might be argued that these patients do not merit a graft as they have not demonstrated their ability to gain control over their disease through durable modification of their  behaviour. Consequently, this procedure could have a negative impact in the public, affecting organ donation and confidence in the fairness of transplant programs. In contrast, ethical principles recommend active treatment of patients, without discrimination, according to the best scientific knowledge. At this stage, we propose that there are no major ethical barriers for further evaluation of this new therapeutic option. The next steps should include transparent communication with the public and further studies to reproduce these results and  identify the selection criteria that provide the best long-term outcomes.;;Donckier V, Lucidi V, Gustot T, Moreno C;;eng;['Hepatitis, Alcoholic/*surgery/therapy', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Patient Selection/ethics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Opinion', 'Temperance/ethics', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];['Alcohol', 'Early', 'Ethic', 'Hepatitis', 'Severe', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1016/j.jhep.2013.11.015

METHODS: In August of 2012,  the authors performed a review of the scientific literature on the ethics of face transplantation, focusing on the evolution of the discussion from before to after the first clinical case in 2005. The authors conducted a primary search (73 peer-reviewed publications) in PubMed using combinations of the terms ""ethics"" and ""face transplantation"" and ""opinions,"" and a secondary search (37 peer-reviewed publications) retrieving publications cited in some of the primary  search findings. In total, the authors reviewed 110 articles. RESULTS: A series of 15 issues were addressed repeatedly throughout the reviewed articles. The authors observed an evolution of the general opinion regarding face transplantation: initially seen almost unanimously as an outlandish and morally objectionable procedure, it began to be accepted as a feasible and necessary treatment option for the most significant facial defects.

567;24277941;Article;2014;Journal of medical ethics;;Should we perform kidney transplants on foreign nationals?;;"In Canada, there are currently no guidelines at either the federal or provincial  level regarding the provision of kidney transplantation services to foreign nationals (FN). Renal transplant centres have, in the past, agreed to put refugee claimants and other FNs on the renal transplant waiting list, in part, because these patients (refugee claimants) had health insurance through the Interim Federal Health Programme to cover the costs of medication and hospital care. However, severe cuts recently made to this programme have forced clinicians to question whether they should continue with transplants for FNs, for financial and ethical reasons. This paper first examines different national policies (eg, in Canada, USA, France and the UK) to map the diversity of approaches regarding transplantation for FNs, and then works through different considerations commonly used to support or oppose the provision of organs to these patients: (1) the organ shortage; (2) the free-rider problem; (3) the risk of becoming a transplant destination; (4) the impact on organ donation rates; (5) physicians' duties; (6)  economic concerns; (7) vulnerability. Using a Canadian case as a focus, and generalising through a review of various national policies, we analyse the arguments for and against transplantation for FNs with a view to bringing clarity to what is a sensitive political and clinical management issue.

One reason for the organ shortage is that candidates for donation must die in the hospital, not the emergency department (ED), either  from neurologic or circulatory-respiratory death under controlled circumstances.  Evidence from Spain and France suggests that a substantial number of deaths from  cardiac arrest may qualify for organ donation using uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) protocols that rapidly initiate organ  preservation in out-of-hospital and ED settings. Despite its potential, uDCDD has been criticized by panels of experts that included neurologists, intensivists, attorneys, and ethicists who suggest that organ preservation strategies that reestablish oxygenated circulation to the brain retroactively negate previous death determination based on circulatory-respiratory criteria and hence violate the dead donor rule. In this article, we assert that in uDCDD, all efforts at saving lives are exhausted before organ donation is considered, and death is determined according to ""irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions"" evidenced by ""persistent cessation of functions during an appropriate  period of observation and/or trial of therapy."" Therefore, postmortem in vivo organ preservation with chest compressions, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is legally and ethically appropriate.

The authors developed a controlled DCD protocol in which comfort therapy is regularly used. The aim of this study was to determine whether this policy shortens the DCD donors' life. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data on patients proposed for DCD at the University Hospital of Liege, Belgium, over a 56-month period. The survival duration of these patients, defined as duration between the time of proposal for  DCD and the time of circulatory arrest, was compared between patients who actually donated organs and those who did not. RESULTS: About 128 patients were considered for controlled DCD and 54 (43%) became donors. Among the 74 non-donor  patients, 34 (46%) objected to organ donation, 38 patients (51%) were denied by the transplant team for various medical reasons, and two potential DCD donors did not undergo procurement due to logistical and organizational reasons. The survival durations were similar in the DCD donor and non-donor groups. No non-donor patient survived. CONCLUSIONS: Survival of DCD donors is not shortened  when compared with non-donor patients. These data support the ethical and respectful approach to potential DCD donors in the authors' center, including regular comfort therapy.;;Ledoux D, Delbouille MH, Deroover A, Lambermont B, Meurisse M, Damas P, Joris J, Detry O;;eng;['Aged', '*Brain Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Longevity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/ethics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Withholding Treatment'];['end-of-life', 'ethics', 'non-heart beating donors', 'organ donation', 'policy', 'transplantation'];;;10.1111/ctr.12276

572;24240831;Article;2013;Current opinion in critical care;;The ethics of hastening death during terminal weaning.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment (LSMT) is under scrutiny as next-of-kin challenge medical decision-making in the courts and established end-of-life pathways are withdrawn in the face of public criticism. With persistent lobbying for medically assisted dying as the other side of the coin, and professional advice that doctors distance themselves from this activity, the fine line between defensible palliative care and hastening a death  needs to be unambiguously defined, particularly with additional confounders such  as transplantation initiatives. RECENT FINDINGS: The medical literature in this domain is dominated by ethical debate on euthanasia and medically assisted dying  rather than defensibility within intensive care at the point of withdrawal of LSMT. SUMMARY: The process and, therefore, the timing of dying is open to manipulation by intensivists, families, other hospital physicians, courts of law  and extraneous influences such as organ donation. Intensivists faced with these challenging processes need to consider some key principles to help them navigate  the management of dying. They need to demonstrate transparency in order to engender trust, be responsive to the dynamically evolving needs of patient and family, avoid ambiguity, show consistency and predictability and, finally, they need to conform with society's expectations and professional standards to achieve defensibility for their actions. Adherence to these principles is likely to minimize conflict, maximize patient benefit, maintain public confidence and avoid professional jeopardy.;;Walton L, Bell D;;eng;['Conflict of Interest', '*Critical Care/ethics/psychology', 'Decision Making', 'Euthanasia, Passive/*ethics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Palliative Care/ethics/psychology', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Public Opinion', '*Quality of Life'];;;;10.1097/MCC.0000000000000027

Using this work as a frame of reference, we analyzed articles on organ transplantation published in internal medicine and transplantation journals between 1995 and 2008 to see whether Fox and Swazey's critiques of organ transplantation were still relevant. METHODS: Using the PubMed database, we retrieved 1,120 articles from the top ten internal medicine journals and 4,644 articles from the two main transplantation journals (Transplantation and American Journal of Transplantation). Out of the internal medicine journal articles, we analyzed those in which organ transplantation was the main topic (349 articles). A total of 349 articles were randomly selected from the transplantation journals for content analysis. RESULTS: In our sample, organ transplantation was described in positive terms and was presented as a routine treatment. Few articles addressed ethical issues, patients' experiences and uncertainties related to organ transplantation. The internal medicine journals reported on more ethical issues than the transplantation journals. The most important ethical issues discussed were related to the justice principle: organ allocation, differential access to transplantation, and the organ shortage. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insight into representations of organ transplantation in the transplant and general medical communities, as reflected in medical journals. The various portrayals of organ transplantation in our sample of articles suggest that Fox and Swazey's critiques of the procedure are still relevant.;;Durand C, Duplantie A, Chabot Y, Doucet H, Fortin MC;;eng;['Bibliometrics', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Internal Medicine/*ethics', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Periodicals as Topic', 'Publishing', 'Risk Assessment', '*Terminology as Topic', '*Tissue Donors/ethics/psychology'];;;;10.1186/1472-6939-14-39

Financial incentives that may be permitted under existing legislation and that pose little risk to existing donation sources should be advanced, including the following: payment of funeral expenses for potential donors who register their decision on organ donation during life (irrespective of the decision to donate or actual organ donation) and removal of disincentives for directed and paired exchange living donation, such as payment of wages, payment for pain and suffering related to the donor surgery, and payment of directed living kidney donors for participation in Canada's paired exchange program. In contrast, it would be premature to contemplate a regulated system of organ sales  that would require a paradigm shift in the current approach to organ donation and legislative change to implement.;;Gill JS, Klarenbach S, Barnieh L, Caulfield T, Knoll G, Levin A, Cole EH;;eng;['Canada', 'Government Regulation', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/ethics/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Needs Assessment/economics/statistics & numerical data', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'State Government', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration'];;;;10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.08.029
582;24182782;Article;2013;Transplantation proceedings;;Renal transplantation in the Roma ethnicity-do all patients have equal chance for transplantation?;;"Racial and ethnic disparities exist in access to kidney transplantation worldwide. The Roma people are often socially deprived, uneducated, and unemployed. We investigated all dialysis centers in Croatia to determine number of Roma people on dialysis as well as their access and reasons for eventual failure to enter the waiting list. There are 9463 registered Roma people in Croatia, however, the estimated number reaches 40,000. Twenty-five Roma patients  required renal replacement therapy, giving a prevalence of 830 per million people (pmp), compared with 959 pmp among the general population. Average age at the start of dialysis was 29 vs 67 years; waiting time to kidney transplantation was  48.9 vs 53.5 months; mean age at the time of transplantation was 33.18 vs 48.01 years in Roma versus the general population respectively. One patient received a  kidney allograft from a living unrelated spousal donor, and all others from deceased individuals. Patients were followed for 51.5 months (range, 6-240). The  most frequent post-transplant complications were urinary tract infections. One patient lost a graft due to severe acute rejection caused by noncompliance. Two young patients were also noncompliant with immunosuppressive medications. One patient died with a functioning graft at 20 years after transplantation due to cardiovascular disease. Among 14 Roma patients currently been treated with hemodialysis in Croatia, 10 are old with clinical contraindications for transplantation; 1 is on the waiting list; 1 left hospitalization for pretransplant evaluation twice; 1 refused evaluation; and 1 is currently being evaluated for the waiting list. The Roma people have excellent access to renal transplantation in Croatia. Many of them refuse evaluation. More efforts should be invested in their education to improve compliance and their post-transplant outcomes.";;Basic-Jukic N, Novosel D, Juric I, Kes P;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Croatia', '*Ethnic Groups', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', '*Roma', '*Social Justice'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2013.06.010
583;24182780;Article;2013;Transplantation proceedings;;Factors of the willingness to consent to the donation of a deceased family member's organs among the Romanian urban population.;;"OBJECTIVES: Romania ranks near the bottom of the European hierarchy of posthumous organ donation rates. Objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to assess the willingness to donate (WTD) a family member's organs in the inhabitants of a large Romanian city (Iasi) and to analyze its factors; and (2) to determine the most important behaviors of the medical staff for our respondents in a hypothetical donation decision scenario. METHODS: The study included a representative sample of the Iasi population. The instrument addressed WTD a family member's organs, both in general and in the particular situation of knowing that the deceased had a positive attitude toward organ donation, knowledge of transplantation-related issues, endorsement of beliefs concerning organ donation, and the importance of a set of medical staff's behaviors. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 1,034 participants, 48% (n = 496) of  whom would most likely consent to donate a family member's organs, 18% (n = 191)  would most likely refuse and 34% (n = 347) were unsure. The following factors were found to influence this variable: believing in the possible reversibility of brain death (P = .004); believing that body integrity should be preserved after death (P < .001); believing that part of the deceased continues to live through the organ recipients (P = .001); and being concerned about mutilation after donation (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The WTD the organs of a deceased next of kin in the Iasi population, even when the deceased had positive attitudes on the matter, is lower than that reported by other studies in other European countries. It is mainly influenced by knowledge and concerns regarding the posthumous manipulation of the body. Consent in a potential donation situation also depends on the way in which the medical staff interacts with the bereaved family.";;Holman A, Karner-Hutuleac A, Ioan B;;eng;['Adult', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Romania', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', '*Urban Population'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2013.05.009

DISCUSSION: Although tissue harvest serves the best interests of recipient siblings, parents are also  obliged to act in the best interests of the donor sibling in the UK. Tissue harvest should proceed if and only if it serves the best interests of both the donor and recipient. Parents should be forbidden, and they are by UK law, to consent to tissue harvest unless there are substantial benefits for an incompetent minor that can outweigh the potential harm. There is no basis to subject a minor to the medical risks of tissue harvest if the recipient sibling can wait without significant risks of complications until the donor becomes Gillick competent. We also argue that the Policy fails to take into account recent advances in haematopoietic transplantation from haploidentical donors or related tissue-matched donors. SUMMARY: Unless a recipient sibling will suffer from serious complications or die without the transplantation and no other medically equivalent donors are available, there is no moral or legal basis to violate the donor sibling's right to bodily integrity. Accordingly, we propose that the Policy should be modified in order to fully satisfy the legal requirements for application in the UK and other commonwealth jurisdictions with  similar statute laws protecting minors.;;Chan TK, Tipoe GL;;eng;['Child', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Humans', '*Living Donors', '*Minors', 'Parental Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', '*Siblings', 'Societies, Medical', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];;;;10.1186/1472-6939-14-43
585;24166860;Article;2014;Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the  Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society;;Ethical considerations surrounding survival benefit-based liver allocation.;;The disparity between the demand for and supply of donor livers has continued to  grow over the last 2 decades, and this has placed greater weight on the need for  efficient and effective liver allocation. Although the use of extended criteria donors has shown great potential, it remains unregulated. A survival benefit-based model was recently proposed to answer calls to increase efficiency  and reduce futile transplants. However, it was previously determined that the current allocation system was not in need of modification and that instead geographic disparities should be addressed. In contrast, we believe that there is a significant need to replace the current allocation system and complement efforts to improve donor liver distribution. We illustrate this need first by identifying major ethical concerns shaping liver allocation and then by using these concerns to identify strengths and shortcomings of the Model for End-Stage  Liver Disease/Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease system and a survival benefit-based model. The latter model is a promising means of improving liver allocation: it incorporates a greater number of ethical principles, uses a sophisticated statistical model to increase efficiency and reduce waste, minimizes bias, and parallels developments in the allocation of other organs. However, it remains limited in its posttransplant predictive accuracy and may raise potential issues regarding informed consent. In addition, the proposed model fails to include quality-of-life concerns and prioritize younger patients.  We feel that it is time to take the next steps toward better liver allocation not only through reductions in geographic disparities but also through the adoption of a model better equipped to balance the many ethical concerns shaping organ allocation. Thus, we support the development of a similar model with suggested amendments.;;Keller EJ, Kwo PY, Helft PR;;eng;['Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'End Stage Liver Disease/*mortality/therapy', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1002/lt.23780

The ethical experiences and perceptions of the healthcare team members involved in facial transplantation procedures and patient care have not been explored. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore healthcare team member experiences of caring for facial transplantation patients, using an ethical framework. METHODS: This study used a  qualitative descriptive design to explore the experiences of 26 multidisciplinary healthcare team members, including professional, ancillary, and support staff who have participated in facial transplantation procedures and patient care. Individual, private, semistructured interviews were conducted. RESULTS: Two main  themes emerged: individual sense of purpose and esprit de corps. Individual sense of purpose describes the meaning of the experience that involvement in facial transplantation had for the participants and comprises three subthemes: ""getting  it right, ""transforming a life,"" and ""spirituality."" The theme esprit de corps conveys the morale of the healthcare team members involved in facial transplantation and was expressed through three subthemes: ""leadership,"" ""teamwork,"" and ""environment.""

The growing  number of patients with ESRD requires new strategies to increase the pool of potential donors. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using decision analysis modeling, this study compared a strategy of paying living kidney donors  to waitlisted recipients on dialysis with the current organ donation system. In the base case estimate, this study assumed that the number of donors would increase by 5% with a payment of $10,000. Quality of life estimates, resource use, and costs (2010 Canadian dollars) were based on the best available published data. RESULTS: Compared with the current organ donation system, a strategy of increasing the number of kidneys for transplantation by 5% by paying living donors $10,000 has an incremental cost-savings of $340 and a gain of 0.11 quality-adjusted life years. Increasing the number of kidneys for transplantation by 10% and 20% would translate into incremental cost-savings of $1640 and $4030 and incremental quality-adjusted life years gain of 0.21 and 0.39, respectively.  CONCLUSION: Although the impact is uncertain, this model suggests that a strategy of paying living donors to increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation could be cost-effective, even with a transplant rate increase of  only 5%. Future work needs to examine the feasibility, legal policy, ethics, and  public perception of a strategy to pay living donors.;;Barnieh L, Gill JS, Klarenbach S, Manns BJ;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Compensation and Redress', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Support Techniques', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility/*economics', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/economics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/economics/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*economics', 'Living Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics', '*Waiting Lists', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.2215/CJN.03350313

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Ninety eight renal allograft recipients (mean age, 51.5 +/- 14.6 years) were prospectively included  in this study. ASL MRI was performed at 1.5T (n = 65) and 3T (n = 33) using a single-slice flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery true-fast imaging with steady-state precession (FAIR True-FISP) sequence in the paracoronal plane. ASL perfusion was regional analyzed for the renal cortex on parameter maps. ASL was compared between patients with good or moderate allograft function (Group a; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] > 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and patients with heavily impaired allograft function (Group b; eGFR </= 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2))  and correlated to renal function as determined by eGFR.

Pre-emptive transplants from living donors offer distinctly greater benefits than those from deceased donors and some pre-emptive transplantation programmes actively encourage living organ donations. Moreover, the offer of a pre-emptive transplant to a patient who is not yet on dialysis unquestionably penalises patients already on dialysis who may have been on the waiting list for a long time. Therefore preemptive transplants give rise to conflicts between justice and utility.

601;24028698;Article;2013;The Milbank quarterly;;Tragic choices and moral compromise: the ethics of allocating kidneys for transplantation.;;"CONTEXT: For almost a decade, the Kidney Transplantation Committee of the United  Network for Organ Sharing has been striving to revise its approach to allocating  kidneys from deceased donors for transplantation. Two fundamental values, equality and efficiency, are central to distributing this scarce resource. The prevailing approach gives primacy to equality in the temporal form of first-come, first-served, whereas the motivation for a new approach is to redeem efficiency by increasing the length of survival of transplanted kidneys and their recipients. But decision making about a better way of allocating kidneys flounders because it is constrained by the amorphous notion of ""balancing"" values. METHODS: This article develops a more fitting, productive approach to resolving the conflict between equality and efficiency by embedding the notion of compromise in the analysis of a tragic choice provided by Guido Calabresi and Philip Bobbitt. For Calabresi and Bobbitt, the goals of public policy with respect to tragic choices are to limit tragedy and to deal with the irreducible minimum of tragedy in the least offensive way. Satisfying the value of efficiency limits tragedy, and satisfying the value of equality deals with the irreducible minimum of tragedy in the least offensive way. But both values cannot be completely satisfied simultaneously. Compromise is occasioned when not all the several obligations that exist in a situation can be met and when neglecting some obligations entirely in order to fulfill others entirely is improper. Compromise  is amalgamated with the notion of a tragic choice and then used to assess proposals for revising the allocation of kidneys considered by the Kidney Transplantation Committee. FINDINGS: Compromise takes two forms in allocating kidneys: it occurs within particular approaches to allocating kidneys because neither equality nor efficiency can be fully satisfied, and it occurs over the course of sequential approaches to allocating kidneys that cycle between preferring equality and efficiency. Ross and colleagues' Equal Opportunity Supplemented by Fair Innings proposal for allocating kidneys best exemplifies the rationality of compromise as a way of achieving the goals of making a tragic choice. CONCLUSIONS: The attempt to design a policy for allocating kidneys from deceased donors for transplantation by balancing the values of equality and efficiency is misguided and unhelpful.

This study aimed to ascertain the perspectives of transplant nephrologists and surgeons on living kidney donor assessment. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 110 transplant nephrologists and surgeons from 43 transplant units in 12 countries from Europe,  Australasia and North America. The challenge of defining acceptable risk to the donor was central to five themes identified: burden of responsibility (personal accountability, policing morality, democratic decision making, meeting legal obligations, optimizing outcomes and innovation, relinquished control); medical protectiveness (prognostic uncertainty, skepticism of donor risk perception, avoidance of undue coercion, concerns for dubious motivations and coercion, safeguard donor well-being, ethical information disclosure); respecting donor autonomy (facilitate informed-decision making, concede to donor risk acceptance,  benefit of the doubt, donor mandate to maintain health, acceptable altruism); driving ideologies (preserving equity, championing living donation, cognizance of anti-paternalism) and contextual pressures (evolving donor demographic, resource  limitations). Living kidney donor assessment involves complex interactions between safeguarding the donors' welfare and respecting their autonomy. In our opinion, authoritative and well-described transplant unit, hospital and public policy positions that make explicit the considerations that are often implicit may reduce the uncertainty within which living donors are assessed today.";;Tong A, Chapman JR, Wong G, Craig JC;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Decision Making', 'Female', '*General Surgery', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nephrology', 'Patient Selection', 'Physicians/ethics/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];['Donor evaluation', 'kidney transplantation', 'live donor transplantation', 'policy', 'qualitative research'];;;10.1111/ajt.12411

If organs are to be treated as property, should they be inheritable? This paper seeks to contribute to the idea of organs as inheritable  property by providing a defence of a default of the family of a dead person as inheritors of transplantable organs. In the course of discussion, various succession rules for organs and their justifications will be suggested. We then consider two objections to organs as inheritable property.

For this reason, critical issues in this type of transplantation differ profoundly from those of other solid organs and, beside a functioning uterus, involve 3 additional steps.  First, at the time of implantation, the quality of embryo is tested by specialized decidual cells surrounding the implanting embryo; such testing is aimed at allowing the development of a normal embryo. Second, from early gestation onward, blood supply to the uterus increases from 45 to 750mL per minute. Vascular anastomoses should support such a marked increase in blood flow. Third, full transformation of spiral arterioles in the placental bed is required  to direct 75% of the uterine blood flow to the intervillous space. Unfortunately, no suitable animal model is available for experimentation. Three overarching ethical issues must be considered. Should organ transplant be conducted when it is not absolutely necessary as a life-saving or quality-of-life-saving measure?

OBJECTIVES:  To assess current attitudes and counselling practices among physicians regarding  intestinal transplant in infants with SBS, and to determine whether counselling and management vary between subspecialists or centres. METHODS: A national sample of practicing paediatric surgeons and neonatologists was surveyed via the American Academy of Paediatrics listserves. Results were analysed by physician subspecialty and again by presence or absence of intestinal transplant at respondent's centre. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 433 respondents, consisting of 363 neonatologists and 70 paediatric surgeons. Fifty-seven respondents (13.2%) practiced at a centre that performed intestinal transplants in children. The vast majority of respondents (91% for preterm, 95% for term neonates) felt that maintaining a neonate with SBS on total parenteral nutrition  for intestinal transplant was ethically optional (neither impermissible nor obligatory), and that parents should be given an informed choice whether to pursue that option. However, only 33% indicated they often/always offer intestinal transplant as a treatment option to families in this situation. CONCLUSIONS: There is a marked disparity between individual physicians' beliefs regarding the acceptability of intestinal transplant for severe SBS and their reported practice. Wide variability exists among physicians with respect to their knowledge, beliefs and practice regarding severe SBS, raising concerns about transparency and justice.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using random digit dialing to phone interview 706 Tehran residents. Patient scenarios were presented to determine interviewee opinions on  nine recipient criteria: probability for survival, previous transplant history, time on the waiting list, age, an individual's role in developing their kidney failure, gender, marital status, social status, and financial situation. Each scenario introduced two patients and interviewees then chose the better candidate for transplantation. RESULTS: More than 50% of the participants chose length of waiting time, a patient's role in causing their disease, age, and survival time after transplantation as important allograft allocation criteria.

Within the medical transplant community, the criterion of prospect for success is highly accepted. As clinicians having a certain scope in decision-making as ""gatekeepers"" in regard to which patient gets on the waiting list and at which stage a patient is defined as ""not transplantable"" and as transplantation centers aspire good success rates, the goal of high prospect for success might become more weighty than intended by legislation and professional guidelines. From an ethical point of view, it is submitted a so-called mediatory approach in between  the two extremes ""sickest-first"" and ""fittest-first.""

These issues are discussed in relation to the various stages of the capital punishment process from the investigation of a  potential capital offence to the removal of executed prisoners' tissues and organs for transplantation. It is suggested that some of the ethical difficulties can be resolved, or at least ameliorated, by having regard to the three core concepts of medical ethics: autonomy, best interests and rights.

Thirty-four publications were identified, including seven guidelines, six consensus statements, and 21 protocols or programs. Guidelines and consensus statements were inconsistent and lacked concreteness for both their content and process, possibly explaining the observed variability in center-specific evaluation protocols and programs. Overall, recommended screening criteria are not evidence-based and an operational definition of the concept ""psychosocial"" is missing, causing heterogeneity in terminology.

Results of a questionnaire at the 12th Congress of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine].;;"BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation is the only treatment option for many patients  with end-organ failure. Due to lack of transplantable organs, patients already on the waiting list die every day. The number of organ donors in Germany fell in 2012 by 12.8 %, reaching its lowest level since 2002. The medical and nursing personnel in intensive care units have a key role in the recruitment of potential organ donors; therefore, a survey was conducted on this subject. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the 12th Congress of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) in December 2012, a point prevalence study using a paper-pencil survey was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1045 questionnaires were analyzed. Of respondents, 81 % favor organ donation in the event of their own brain death. The approval rate in the medical profession was 84 % and 75 % of the nursing profession. Only 45.3 % of the participants (47 % physicians, nursing 44 %) had an organ donor card and nearly half (45 %) had already confided their opinion towards organ donation to their family or friends. The main reasons for a lack of acceptance of organ donation was the concept of brain death (40 %), fear of abuse by organ trade (29 %), and the lack of integrity of the body after death (11 %). The particularly intense discussion about organ donation and transplantation in 2012 resulted in a predominantly negative change of attitude in 45 % of respondents. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of the intensive care personnel supports organ donation, but less than half of the respondents have an organ donor card. The reports of irregularities in the organ allocation were scrutinized, but had apparently no significant impact on the individual and collective fundamental donor decision.";;Soffker G, Bhattarai M, Welte T, Quintel M, Kluge S;;ger;['*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Congresses as Topic', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Critical Care/*ethics', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Societies, Medical', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Terminal Care/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1007/s00063-013-0271-x

As this procedure is thought to challenge many ethical, physiological, and social points of views, we believe that it is important for a surgical team to have insight into their population's perception  and general thoughts concerning the issue.;;Ozmen S, Findikcioglu F, Sezgin B, Findikcioglu K, Kucuker I, Atabay K;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Facial Transplantation/ethics/*psychology', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Religion', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics', 'Turkey', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1097/SAP.0b013e31826cadd2

The ideal allocation system is guided by ethical principles and scientifically accurate at identifying patients who will gain the greatest degree of benefit from receiving the organ, in terms of both pre- and posttransplantation survival. The lung allocation score (LAS) was developed in 2005 to reduce mortality on the  wait list, prioritize candidates based on urgency, minimize the role of geography, and maximize transplant benefit. The LAS has not made much of an impact on the geographic disparity of listing patients for lung transplantation,  but it did achieve the goal of reducing wait-list mortality and prioritizing patients based on urgency. In prioritizing patients with the most urgent status,  a new controversy has come into the forefront: whether or not the increased number of critically ill recipients maximizes transplant benefit. Despite the controversy, the LAS system is an improvement compared with the traditional first-come, first-served system, and it has even been adopted by Eurotransplant.  In the future, as modifications are made to improve the LAS, the issue of critically ill patients and maximizing posttransplant benefit will be the focus.;;McShane PJ, Garrity ER Jr;;eng;['Critical Illness', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Lung Transplantation/ethics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*statistics & numerical data', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1055/s-0033-1348461

Because consent and management of potential donors must occur before death, DCDD raises unique ethical and policy issues. OBJECTIVES: To develop an ethics and health policy statement on adult and pediatric DCDD relevant to critical care and transplantation stakeholders. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of stakeholders  was convened to develop an ethics and health policy statement. The panel consisted of representatives from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, and the United Network of Organ Sharing. The panel reviewed the literature, discussed important ethics and health policy considerations, and developed a guiding framework for decision making by stakeholders. RESULTS: A framework to guide ethics and health policy statement was established, which addressed the consent process, pre- and post mortem interventions, the determination of death, provisions of end-of-life care, and pediatric DCDD.

MELD allocation and the great number of transplant centers had a negative influence on outcome in Germany. Typical surgical issues following transplantation are vascular thrombosis and the development of biliary lesions. Nonanastomotic strictures impact graft survival and cause considerable posttransplant morbidity. Nonsurgical issues in LT are hepatitis C reinfection, selection of appropriate patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and individualized immunosuppression. In hepatitis C the new antiviral drugs (protease and polymerase inhibitors) are promising tools to prevent reinfection. Nephrotoxicity caused by calcineurin inhibitors - which remain the mainstay of immunosuppression - can only partially  be avoided. So far, alternative forms of treatment using mycophenolic acid and mTOR inhibitors cannot totally replace calcineurin inhibitors. In view of graft scarcity, we need to think about a benefit-based model of liver allocation which  focuses on the optimal use of this resource. Deciding on this form of organ allocation requires an ethical consensus: not the most urgent patient is the first candidate to receive a graft, but rather the patient who is supposed to have the greatest benefit.;;Otto G;;eng;['Graft Survival/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', '*Liver Transplantation/ethics', 'Survival Analysis'];;;;10.1159/000347213

We hypothesized that surgeons are not accurate at predicting donor-specific risks. Surgeon members of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons were invited to complete a survey in which they predicted the 3-year risk of graft failure for a 53-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 21 with a liver from (1) a 30-year-old local donor with traumatic brain death or (2) a 64-year-old regional donor with brain death from a stroke. Complete responses were obtained from 201 surgeons, whose self-reported case volume represents the majority of liver transplants in the United States. The surgeon-predicted 3-year risk of graft failure varied widely (more than 10-fold). In scenario 1, 90% of the respondents provided lower estimates of the graft failure risk than the literature-derived estimate of 21% (P < 0.001). In scenario 2, 96% of the responses were lower than the literature-derived estimate of 40% (P < 0.001).

Nonparent living donors for urgent pediatric transplant recipients are a unique donor candidate population with specific considerations that need to be acknowledged and addressed by the independent donor advocacy team. Such a team educates about donation, identifies  potential contraindications, examines the distant relationships between donor and recipient, and considers ethical issues about the ability to make an informed decision in an urgent situation. A center for living donation dealt with such ethical issues when a donor candidate with a distant relationship was evaluated for living donation. Multiple relative contraindications were identified, and the donor candidate was declined. Careful management by the independent donor advocacy team is necessary to ensure the psychosocial safety and to provide needed psychosocial support and intervention for donor candidates with psychological contraindications to donation.

However, uncertainty remains among both the transplantation community and lay public with regard to the intention, motivation, and legitimacy of such donors. Even within programs that use unspecified kidney donors, there is a lack of consensus regarding how to optimize the potential of the gifted kidney (and indirectly potentiate the altruistic benefit for the donor). Despite emerging guidance on how to work up unspecified donors, centers have adopted individualized unspecified donor pathways with regards to assessment, evaluation, and use. There are a variety of  models for unspecified kidney donation, ranging from donation directly to deceased-donor waiting lists to benefit one recipient or chain transplantations occurring simultaneously (domino-paired donation) or nonsimultaneously (extended  altruistic donor chains) to benefit many. After a brief exploration on the basis  of altruism, this review will discuss the assessment, evaluation, and reported outcomes associated with unspecified kidney donation. It will also critique current utilization models and highlight some unresolved controversies.

Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy has been favored due to its multiple benefits. The aim of this  study was to explore the safety and feasibility of kidney transplantation by a laparoscopic technique in a pig model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the university animal ethics committee. Eight female pigs (Sus Scrofra, weighing 45-50 kg) were divided into 2 groups: group I included 4 animals that underwent laparoscopic kidney orthotopic transplantation on the left side. The right kidney was remained functional in situ. The pigs recovered and were observed for 1 week. In the 4 hosts group II pigs underwent a laparoscopic kidney transplantation on the left side. With simultaneous clipping of the right  ureter. After recovery, the pigs were observed for 4 weeks. A laparotomy for examination was performed prior to euthanasia. RESULTS: All 4 group I pigs survived for 1 week. The laparotomy showed normal graft perfusion with wall patent renal artery and vein as well as satisfactory urine output upon transection of ureter in 3 hosts. Renal artery stenosis occurred in one pig. In The Immediate kidney graft function was achieved in 3 group II pigs. The fourth died following extubation due to laryngospasm despite a functional graft. The average creatinine levels were 195.5 mumol/L on day 3; 224.5 mumol/L at week 1; 127 mumol/L at week 2; 182.7 umol/L at week 3; and 154.7 umol/L at week 4.

This new method of treatment would allow women, who currently rely on gestational surrogacy or adoption, to gestate and birth their own genetic offspring. Since uterus transplantation carries significant risk when compared with surrogacy and adoption as well as when compared with other organ transplants, it requires greater justification because its goals are quality of life, not life-saving, in  their scope.

For HIV+ transplant candidates, who face high barriers to transplant access, this prohibition violates beneficence by placing an unjustified limitation on the organ supply. However, transplanting HIV+ organs raises nonmaleficence concerns given limited data on recipient outcomes. Informed consent and careful monitoring of outcome data should mitigate these concerns, even in the rare circumstance when an HIV+ organ is intentionally transplanted into an HIV-negative recipient. For potential donors, the federal ban on transplanting HIV+ organs raises justice concerns. While in practice there are a  number of medical criteria that preclude organ donation, only HIV+ status is singled out as a mandated exclusion to donation under the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA). Operational objections could be addressed by adapting existing approaches used for organ donors with hepatitis. Center-specific outcomes should be adjusted for HIV donor and recipient status. In summary, transplant professionals should advocate for eliminating the ban on HIV+ organ donation and funding studies to determine outcomes after transplantation of these organs.;;Mgbako O, Glazier A, Blumberg E, Reese PP;;eng;['*Ethics, Medical', '*HIV Seropositivity', 'Humans', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/ethnology/methods', 'Risk Factors', '*Tissue Donors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/supply & distribution', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/methods'];;;K23 DK078688/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.12311
641;23743726;Article;2013;Transplantation;;Mental health disorders and solid-organ transplant recipients.;;Depression affects up to 60% of solid-organ recipients and is independently associated with both mortality (hazard ratio for death of ~2) and de novo malignancy after transplantation, although the mechanism is not clear. Both pretransplantation psychosis and depression occurring more than 2 years after transplantation are associated with increased noncompliance and graft loss. It remains to be shown that effective treatment of depression is associated with improved outcomes and quality of life. Immunosuppressive drugs (especially corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors) and physiologic challenges can precipitate deterioration in mental health. All potential transplant candidates should be assessed for mental health problems and preexisting medical conditions  that can mimic mental health problems, such as uremic, hepatic, or hypoxic encephalopathy, should be identified and treated appropriately. Expert mental health review of those with identified risk factors (such as previous suicide attempts, history of mental illness or noncompliance with medications) is advisable early in the transplant assessment process to mitigate risk and support the patient. Patients with mental health disorders, when adequately controlled and socially supported, have outcomes similar to the general transplant population. Therefore, exclusion from transplantation based on the diagnosis alone is neither ethically nor medically justified. However, it is ethically and  clinically justifiable to deny access to transplantation to those who, despite full support, would have a quality of life that is unacceptable to the candidate  or are likely to be noncompliant with treatment or follow-up, which would lead to graft loss.;;Corbett C, Armstrong MJ, Parker R, Webb K, Neuberger JM;;eng;['Comorbidity', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects/ethics/mortality/*psychology', 'Mental Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/therapy', '*Mental Health/ethics', 'Patient Compliance', '*Patient Selection/ethics', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;G1100448/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1097/TP.0b013e31829584e0

Organ donation and the choice between palliation and ventilation.;;Organ donation after brain death provides the most important source for deceased  organs for transplantation, both because of the number of potential organ donors  that it makes available and also because of the unparalleled viability of the organs retrieved. Analysis of worldwide deceased organ donation rates demonstrates that all countries with high deceased organ donation rates (>20 donors per million population per year) have high brain death rates (>40 brain deaths per million population per year). This analysis makes it clear that countries striving to increase their deceased organ donor rates to world leading  levels must increase the rates of donation after brain death. For countries with  end-of-life care strategies that stress palliation, advance care planning and treatment withdrawal for the terminally ill, the adoption of initiatives to meaningfully raise deceased donor rates will require increasing the rate at which brain death is diagnosed. This poses a difficult, and perhaps intractable, medical, ethical and sociocultural challenge as the changes that would be required to increase rates of brain death would mean conjugating an intimate clinical and cultural focus on the dying patient with the notion of how this person's death might be best managed to be of benefit to others.;;Bendorf A, Kerridge IH, Stewart C;;eng;['Brain Death/*diagnosis', '*Choice Behavior', 'Humans', 'Terminal Care/ethics/*methods', '*Tissue Donors/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*methods'];;;;10.1186/cc12553

Unfortunately, the demand for kidneys for transplantation far exceeds the available supply. It is important, therefore, that we understand the factors that may influence kidney donation rates. While certain socio-demographic factors have been linked to kidney donation rates, few  studies have examined the influence of multiple socio-demographic factors on rates of both living and deceased kidney transplantation (KT) and none have examined their comparative effect in large numbers of culturally and socio-politically diverse countries. METHOD: In this study, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses of the influence of 15 socio-economic factors on both the living donor (LD) and the deceased donor (DD) kidney transplantation rates (KTR) in 53 countries. RESULTS: Our analyses demonstrated that factors such as UN HDI (United Nations Human Development Index), religion, GDP, education, age, healthcare expenditure, presumed consent legislation and existence of a nationally managed organ donation program were associated with higher deceased KTR. In contrast, the only factors associated with living KTR were a highly significant negative association with presumed consent and variable associations with different religions.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network for US organ recipients and donors from 2001 to 2010 stratified according to age, organ, and deceased donor type (DCDD or donation after neurologic determination of death). Additional data included transplant wait-list removals due to death. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2010, pediatric organ transplant recipients increased from 1170 to 1475. Organs from DCDD donors were transplanted into children infrequently but increased from 1 to 31. Pediatric donation after neurologic determination of death decreased by 13% whereas DCDD increased by 174% (50 to 137). Recipients of pediatric grafts decreased from 3042 to 2751. Adults receiving grafts from pediatric donors decreased from 2243 to 1780; children receiving pediatric grafts increased from 799 to 971.

646;23678629;Article;2013;Kennedy Institute of Ethics journal;;"Brain death, paternalism, and the language of ""death"".";;The controversy surrounding the dead donor rule and the adequacy of neurological  criteria for death continues unabated. However, despite disagreement on fundamental theoretical questions, I argue that there is significant (but not complete) agreement on the permissibility of organ retrieval from heart-beating donors. Many disagreements are rooted in disputes surrounding language meaning and use, rather than the practices of transplant medicine. Thus I suggest that the debate can be fruitfully recast in terms of a dispute about language. Given this recasting, I argue that the language used to describe organ donation is misleading and paternalistic. Finally, I suggest that the near-agreement on the permissibility of heart-beating organ retrieval ought to be reconsidered. If the  paternalism is not justified, then either the language used to describe organ transplantation must change radically, or it would seem to follow that much of the transplant enterprise lacks ethical justification.;;Nair-Collins M;;eng;['*Brain Death/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Comprehension', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', '*Language', 'Morals', '*Paternalism/ethics', 'Persistent Vegetative State', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Public Opinion', 'Religion', '*Terminology as Topic', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Trust', 'Truth Disclosure/*ethics'];;;;10.1353/ken.2013.0002

Yet, public views on living donation are not well understood. This study aims to synthesize studies on public awareness and attitudes toward living organ donation. METHODS: Electronic databases and reference lists were searched to September 2012. Summary estimates from survey data were obtained by random effects meta-analysis. Qualitative descriptive synthesis of each study was performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies involving 34,610 respondents were included. The proportion of respondents aware of living organ donation was 76.7% (4 studies, n=3248; 95% confidence interval, 46.2%-97.0%; I=99.7%). The majority were in favor of living directed donation (85.5% (11 studies, n=15,836; 95% confidence interval, 81.6%-89.6%; I=98%), with  recipient and community benefit as the rationale provided. However, barriers included fear of surgical and health risks, lack of knowledge, respect for cultural norms, financial loss, distrust in hospitals, and avoiding recipient indebtedness. The public voiced concern about possible risks or an obligatory pressure exerted on the donor. Many supported reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, paid leave, wait-listing priority, health insurance, and donor acknowledgment. There was strong opposition to financial incentives, which they believed risked exploitation and inequity and diminished voluntary altruistic donation. CONCLUSIONS: The public is generally supportive of living donation and  articulated important equity and ethical considerations for protecting the health and safety of living donors. This supports increased public engagement and strengthening of a shared view among professionals and the public in living donation practice and policy.";;Tong A, Chapman JR, Wong G, Josephson MA, Craig JC;;eng;['*Awareness', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Living Donors/psychology', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics'];;;;10.1097/TP.0b013e31829282ac
648;23667452;Article;2013;PloS one;;An international comparison of the effect of policy shifts to organ donation following cardiocirculatory death (DCD) on donation rates after brain death (DBD) and transplantation rates.;;"During the past decade an increasing number of countries have adopted policies that emphasize donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) in an attempt to address the widening gap between the demand for transplantable organs and the availability of organs from donation after brain death (DBD) donors. In order to  examine how these policy shifts have affected overall deceased organ donor (DD) and DBD rates, we analyzed deceased donation rates from 82 countries from 2000-2010. On average, overall DD, DBD and DCD rates have increased over time, with the proportion of DCD increasing 0.3% per year (p = 0.01). Countries with higher DCD rates have, on average, lower DBD rates. For every one-per million population (pmp) increase in the DCD rate, the average DBD rate decreased by 1.02 pmp (95% CI: 0.73, 1.32; p<0.0001). We also found that the number of organs transplanted per donor was significantly lower in DCD when compared to DBD donors with 1.51 less transplants per DCD compared to DBD (95% CI: 1.23, 1.79; p<0.001). Whilst the results do not infer a causal relationship between increased DCD and decreased DBD rates, the significant correlation between higher DCD and lower DBD rates coupled with the reduced number of organs transplanted per DCD donor suggests that a national policy focus on DCD may lead to an overall reduction in  the number of transplants performed.";;Bendorf A, Kelly PJ, Kerridge IH, McCaughan GW, Myerson B, Stewart C, Pussell BA;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Humans', '*Internationality', 'Organ Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', '*Public Policy', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0062010
649;23664593;Article;2013;The Journal of surgical research;;Soluble FGL2 induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma in CD4+  T cells through MAPK pathway in human renal allograft acute rejection.;;BACKGROUND: Acute rejection (AR), initiated by alloreactive CD4(+) T cells, hampers allograft survival. Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2) is a novel  effector of CD4(+) T cells. We previously found that serum sFGL2 significantly increased in renal allograft recipients with AR. In this study, sFGL2 secretion by CD4(+) T cells and its mechanism were further explored both in vivo and in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty cases of living-related renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven AR or stable renal function were collected and detected serum sFGL2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma, and peripheral CD4(+) T cells. In vitro, the isolated human CD4(+) T cells were stimulated by TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma. sFGL2 in the supernatant and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins in the CD4(+) T cells were investigated. Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Fudan University. RESULTS: sFGL2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and CD4(+) T cells were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of renal allograft recipients with AR. Stimulation with 1000 U/mL TNF-alpha or 62.5 U/mL IFN-gamma for 48 h provided an optimal condition for CD4(+) T cells to secrete sFGL2 in vitro. Phosphorylated (p-) c-Jun N-terminal kinase was remarkably upregulated in the activated CD4(+) T cells, whereas no significant changes were found in p-p38 MAPK or p-ERK1/2 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase significantly reduced sFGL2 secretion by CD4(+) T cells. CONCLUSIONS: sFGL2 secretion by CD4(+) T cells can be induced with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma stimulation through MAPK signaling in renal allograft AR. Our study suggests that sFGL2 is a potential mediator in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection.;;Zhao Z, Wang L, Yang C, Zhao T, Li L, Hu L, Wu D, Rong R, Xu M, Zhu T;;eng;['Adult', 'Allografts', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Graft Rejection/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology'];['CD4(+) T cells', 'MAPK pathway', 'Renal allograft rejection', 'Soluble FGL2', 'TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma'];;;10.1016/j.jss.2013.04.011

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the research ethics committee and informed consent was obtained. Heart transplant recipients (n = 138) scheduled for routine invasive angiography were prospectively enrolled to undergo CT to evaluate coronary artery calcification and retrospectively gated cardiac CT angiography with a 64-section scanner. The cardiac CT angiographic images were systematically analyzed for image quality. Degree of CAV was assessed by using a 15-coronary segments model. The area under  the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of cardiac CT angiography for detection of CAV with any degree of stenosis and greater than or equal to 50% stenosis were calculated. RESULTS: Coronary artery calcification was absent in 82 patients, five (6%) of whom had CAV with 50% or more stenosis. Interpretable image quality  was obtained in 130 (96%) of the 136 patients who completed the study and 1900 (98%) of 1948 segments. At the patient level, cardiac CT angiography had an area  under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and  positive and negative predictive values of 0.880 (95% confidence interval: 0.819, 0.941), 98%, 78%, 77%, and 98%, respectively, for diagnosis of CAV with any degree of stenosis, but for CAV with 50% or more stenosis, the corresponding values were 0.942 (95% confidence interval: 0.885, 1.000), 96%, 93%, 72%, and 99%, respectively. None of the 61 patients with normal cardiac CT angiographic results had CAV on the basis of invasive angiographic images. CONCLUSION: The study results show that cardiac CT angiography compares favorably with invasive angiography in detecting CAV in heart transplant recipients and may be a preferable screening technique because of its noninvasive nature. The absence of  coronary artery calcification alone is not reliable enough for excluding CAV.;;Mittal TK, Panicker MG, Mitchell AG, Banner NR;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary Angiography/*methods', 'Coronary Artery Disease/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Iohexol/analogs & derivatives', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods'];;;;10.1148/radiol.13121440

The most common source of organs was impoverished people in India, Pakistan, Egypt, and the Philippines, deceased organ donors in Colombia, and executed prisoners in China. In response, in May 2008, The Transplantation Society and the International Society of Nephrology developed the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism consisting of a preamble, a set of principles, and a series of proposals. Promulgation of the Declaration of Istanbul and the formation of the Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group to promote and uphold its principles have demonstrated that concerted, strategic, collaborative, and persistent actions by professionals can deliver tangible changes. Over the past 5 years, the Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group organized and encouraged cooperation among professional bodies and relevant international, regional, and national governmental organizations, which has produced significant progress in combating organ trafficking and transplant tourism around the world.

658;23570691;Article;2013;Medical law review;;Non-standard kidneys for transplants: clinical margins, medical morality, and the law.;;Advances in kidney transplantation over the past six decades have been impressive, but have not eliminated the significant variability in outcome related to donor organ quality. Organ shortage means that, in addition to 'standard' deceased donor kidneys (SD), 'non-standard donor' (NSD), 'expanded criteria donor', or 'marginal' kidneys, which fail to meet standard criteria and  are often associated with less good outcomes, are now being transplanted into selected recipients as a means of increasing the donor pool. A similar, but less-documented, practice has developed in living donation. This article outlines the clinical rationale and ethical argument underpinning the use of such donor kidneys and examines their legal status in the UK, which we claim remains largely undefined and untested. While it is probable that the general principles governing medico-legal consent and liability also apply to organ donation, the special circumstances of donation, notably the inadequate supply of donors and the emphasis on a 'gift relationship', make it difficult to know how far existing medico-legal precedents can or should apply. The non-standard status of deceased  donor organs creates potential problems for the validity of 'appropriate consent' to donation required by statute. It may also be relevant to the use of interventions intended to optimise deceased donor organ quality. Furthermore, the SD/NSD distinction in clinical practice may produce unexpected legal effects. For example, the recent UK Regulations 2012, which bring into force the EU Directive  on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation,  could produce a negative legal restraint on the use of NSD kidneys. There is an urgent need for clarification of the effect of using NSDs in areas such as recipient and donor consent, liability for negligence, and the law of product liability. Some argue that the need for non-standard organs results from society's failure to compel the retrieval of all suitable standard organs from the deceased as a community resource. However, the Human Tissue Acts of 2004 and  2006 (Scotland), which govern organ donation and transplantation in the UK, expressly require individual consent or authorisation in the decision to donate.  This emphasis on individual autonomy appears to chime with prevailing public opinion. However, the sense of medico-legal security gained by uncritical observance of the existing law and of directives published under its authority may be an obstacle to the development of a system which adequately meets the needs of recipients while safeguarding donor autonomy.;;Cronin AJ, Douglas JF;;eng;['Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Morals', 'Tissue Donors/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];['non-standard organs for transplant', 'organ donation and transplantation', 'organ donor quality'];;MR/J006742/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1093/medlaw/fwt015

Twelve guidelines, however, would exceptionally allow living kidney donation by minors, provided that adequate safeguards are put in place, including an assessment of the minor's autonomy and  maturity, authorization by an independent body, assuring that the anticipated psychosocial benefits outweigh the medical and psychosocial risks for the donor and the restriction to situations of last resort.

Further, I argue that a misdiagnosis of the problem, as one about ""religious extremism"" or a ""civilizational clash,"" has obfuscated unresolved concerns about fairness, access, and justice within Egyptian medical spheres.

Over the last decade, kidney transplant by laparoscopic or robotic techniques have been explored. The aim of this study is to establish a new laparoscopic technique for kidney orthotopic transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University. Ten live female pigs (Sus scrofa), weighing 45-50 kg, underwent laparoscopic kidney orthotopic transplant on left side under general anesthesia,  and the opposite right kidney was defunctioned by complete ligation of the ureter at the same time. RESULTS: The vital signs of all pigs were stable during the surgery and postoperative period. There were no intraoperative complications and  no conversion to open surgery. The laparoscopic kidney transplant was successful  in seven of 10 pigs. Seven pigs were observed up to 4 wk as planned in the study. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study of laparoscopic kidney orthotopic transplant in pig model with satisfactory immediate graft function. It was demonstrated that laparoscopic kidney transplant is a feasible, reliable, and safe procedure. However, it is a very demanding technique. Adequate training is mandatory for performing laparoscopic kidney transplant.

Donations between emotionally related donor and recipients (especially from parents to their children) increased the acceptability of an LLD compared with those between strangers. Most healthcare professionals (HCPs) disapproved of altruistic stranger donations, considering them to entail an unacceptable degree of risk taking. Participants tended to emphasise the need to balance the harms of proceeding against those of not proceeding, rather than calculating the harm-to-benefits ratio of donor versus recipient. Participants' views suggested that a complex process of negotiation is required, which respects the autonomy of donor, recipient and HCP. Although they considered that, of the three, donor autonomy is of primary importance, they also placed considerable weight on their  own autonomy. Our participants suggest that their opinions about acceptable risk  taking were more objective than those of the recipient or donor and were therefore given greater weight. However, it was clear that more subjective values were also influential. Processes used in live kidney donation (LKD) were thought  to be a good model for LLD, but our participants stressed that there is a danger  that patients may underestimate the risks involved in LLD if it is too closely associated with LKD.;;Thomas EH, Bramhall SR, Herington J, Draper H;;eng;"['Altruism', 'Comprehension', 'Family', 'Hepatectomy/adverse effects/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics', '*Living Donors/psychology', 'Nephrectomy/adverse effects/*ethics', '*Personal Autonomy', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*ethics"", '*Risk-Taking', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics']";['Autonomy', 'Clinical Ethics', 'Transplantation'];;G0800808/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1136/medethics-2012-101261

In the academic literature and professional guidelines, little attention is paid to the development of an ethical framework for this practice. The focus is frequently limited to the donation of regenerative tissues and kidneys. However, liver donation differs in important respects because of the increased medical risks and the lack of substitute therapies. Therefore, in this  article, we assess whether living liver donation by minors is ethically appropriate. We argue that living liver donation by minors is justifiable only if minors possess the capacity to consent to donation or if the procedure is in their best interests. Although minors may possess adult-like levels of cognitive  maturity, they lack sufficient psychosocial maturity to give valid consent to donation. In addition, living liver donation is generally not in a minor's best interests. With respect to the latter, the potential psychological benefits that  a minor may experience as a result of living liver donation are insufficiently empirically supported and are unlikely to outweigh the short- and long-term medical and psychological risks. Therefore, we conclude that minors should not be considered as potential living liver donors.;;Capitaine L, Thys K, Van Assche K, Sterckx S, Pennings G;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/methods', 'Living Donors/*ethics/*psychology', 'Minors/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology', 'United States'];;;;10.1002/lt.23633
669;23460587;Article;2013;Asia-Pacific journal of public health;;The organ transplantation act and recent trends in Korea.;;The Organ Transplantation Act, including transplantation of organs from brain-dead donors, entered into force in Korea on February 9, 2000. This article  introduces the Organ Transplantation Act, focusing on scope of the Act, determination of brain death, removal of organs from brain-dead or deceased donors, removal from living donors, organ allocation, and prohibition of trade in human organs. Especially, some primary ethical dilemmas surrounding organ allocation arise from the shortage of available organs. The primary ethical problems surrounding organ allocation are as follows. A key purpose of the organ  donation incentive system is to increase the number of organ transplants from brain-dead donors. In particular, the priority for kidney patient was allowed in  consideration of doctor's strong desire to increase the brain-dead donors. Also,  the organ allocation criteria based on the organ donation incentive system appear unfair, especially for the kidney patient, because the criteria do not fit the principles of distributive justice. In the future, the organ donation incentive system itself may need to be reexamined.;;Joo HN;;eng;['Brain Death/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*legislation & jurisprudence/*trends', 'Republic of Korea', 'Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1177/1010539513476935

Because of this, the publication of research can serve as a tacit endorsement of the methodology behind the science. This becomes  a problem when vulnerable populations that are incapable of giving legitimate informed consent, such as prisoners, are used in research. The problem is especially critical in the field of transplant research, in which unverified consent can enable research that exploits the vulnerabilities of prisoners, especially those awaiting execution. Because the doctrine of informed consent is  central to the protection of vulnerable populations, we have performed a historical analysis of the standards of informed consent in codes of international human subject protections to form the foundation for our limit and  ban recommendations: (1) limit the publication of transplant research involving prisoners in general and (2) ban the publication of transplant research involving executed prisoners in particular.;;Valapour M, Paulson KM, Hilde A;;eng;['Biomedical Research/ethics/history/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Capital Punishment/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Editorial Policies', '*Government Regulation', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/history/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/history/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Periodicals as Topic/ethics/history/*legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prisoners/history/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Research Subjects/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence/supply & distribution', 'Vulnerable Populations/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;K23HL06210/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1002/lt.23603

672;25163343;Article;2013;Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine;;[Cardiac graft allocation].;;Until 2004, French rules for cardiac graft allocation were aimed at ensuring uniform organ distribution on the national scale, while logically giving priority to local teams. The allocation was center-based, with transplant MDs choosing the most suitable recipient from the local waiting list. In 2004, two national priority lists were added to the French cardiac graft allocation system. High Emergency 1 (HE1) is for patients with unstable hemodynamic status (on inotropes  or ECMO), while High Emergency 2 (HE2) is for patients who develop complications  during long-term circulatory support. Data from the French Biomedicines Agency show significantly poorer survival for HE1 patients than for HE2 patients. However, this should not lead to the conclusion that HE2 is a better strategy, as mortality during long-term circulatory support is not taken into account, and it  is well known that the survival benefit of transplantation is significantly better in HE1 patients. Furthermore, the risk related to the quality of the cardiac graft must be taken into account. Indeed, the decision to transplant or not to transplant an HE1 patient with a given graft will impact not only the survival of the patient concerned, but also the waiting time of the other patients on the list, independently of allocation rules. This is also true for the criteria used to place a patient on the waiting list. Each cardiac transplantation team considers the level of risk before adding a patient to the waiting list, and this will impact not only the individual candidate but also the entire waiting list. Thus, even if allocation rules aim to provide all patients with the same chance of being transplanted across the entire country, the medical decision to accept a cardiac graft and to register a patient on the waiting list  will make this process somewhat heterogeneous. This allows cardiac transplantation to be adapted to each individual case, independently of the rules. However, a multidisciplinary decision process is necessary to ensure fairness.;;Leprince P;;fre;['Emergencies', 'France', '*Heart Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence/methods/standards', 'Humans', '*Patient Selection/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;

Nevertheless, in Japan, the New York State, and  the State of New Jersey, death is declared based not on brain death criteria, but on cardio-pulmonary criteria. In Japan, the 1997 Organ Transplant Law legalized brain death determination exclusively when organs were to be procured from brain-dead patients. Even after 2009 law revision, the default definition of death continued to be based on cardio-pulmonary criteria, despite the criticism.  The cases of Japan and the United States provide a good reference as social experiments of appreciating conscientious or religio-cultural dimensions in health care. This text theoretically examines the 1997 organ transplant law of Japan and its 2009 revision, presenting some characteristics of Japan's case compared to American cases and the implications its approach has for the rest of  the world.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although living donors undertake considerable medical risks for no direct medical benefit, the question  remains whether the risks are acceptable and should be tolerated by providers and patients or whether additional interventions and safeguards are needed to reduce  and/or prevent complications. By reviewing complication risk statistics and synthesizing empirical research regarding risk-taking thresholds and attitudes, this paper examines the possibilities for determining an acceptable level of complication risk for living donors. This paper also delineates the ethical tensions surrounding protecting donors from unnecessary risk versus respecting donor autonomy to accept risks, and concludes by discussing the importance of donor follow-up and the value of donor registries. SUMMARY: In the absence of information on long-term donor outcomes, transplant centers should take special precautions to protect prospective donors given increasing pressures to reduce the organ shortage and concerns that donors often disregard risks to themselves to save the lives of others.;;Gordon EJ;;eng;['Humans', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Morals', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Registries/ethics', 'Risk-Taking'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0b013e32835f3f2c

However, local tourists have escaped the regulatory radar, leaving a very wide gap in efforts against human trafficking and transplant tourism. Authorities need to deal with the situation seriously, at a minimum, by issuing clear procedures for verifying  declarations of kinship or emotional bonds between donors and recipients. Foreigners who come to the country for transplants with same-nationality donors constitute a problem that is replicated in many transplant centers around the world. Also, emotionally related living donors continue to pose challenges for ethics committees, especially because of the realities associated with the existence of extended families. Those who find themselves facing these issues need to be armed with clear protocols for going through the process of verifying  documents and individual declarations assiduously. There is also a need for international referral mechanisms at least to ensure that governments are aware when their citizens travel for transplant so they can take steps they consider suitable to address the vulnerabilities of exploited persons.;;de Castro LD;;eng;['Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data', '*Medical Tourism/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data', '*Organ Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data', 'Philippines', 'Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1007/s11019-013-9474-4
678;23396563;Article;2013;BMJ open;;Ethical and legal implications of the risks of medical tourism for patients: a qualitative study of Canadian health and safety representatives' perspectives.;;"OBJECTIVES: Medical tourism involves patients' intentional travel to privately obtain medical care in another country. Empirical evidence regarding health and safety risks facing medical tourists is limited. Consideration of this issue is dominated by speculation and lacks meaningful input from people with specific expertise in patient health and safety. We consulted with patient health and safety experts in the Canadian province of British Columbia to explore their views concerning risks that medical tourists may be exposed to. Herein, we report on the findings, linking them to existing ethical and legal issues associated with medical tourism. DESIGN: We held a focus group in September 2011 in Vancouver, British Columbia with professionals representing different domains of  patient health and safety expertise. The focus group was transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS: Seven professionals representing the domains of tissue banking, blood safety, health records, organ transplantation, dental care, clinical ethics and infection control participated. RESULTS: Five dominant  health and safety risks for outbound medical tourists were identified by participants: (1) complications; (2) specific concerns regarding organ transplantation; (3) transmission of antibiotic-resistant organisms; (4) (dis)continuity of medical documentation and (5) (un)informed decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Concern was expressed that medical tourism might have unintended and undesired effects upon patients' home healthcare systems. The individual choices  of medical tourists could have significant public consequences if healthcare facilities in their home countries must expend resources treating postoperative complications. Participants also expressed concern that medical tourists returning home with infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant infections, could place others at risk of exposure to infections that are refractory to standard treatment regimens and thereby pose significant public health risks.";;Crooks VA, Turner L, Cohen IG, Bristeir J, Snyder J, Casey V, Whitmore R;;eng;;;;;10.1136/bmjopen-2012-002302

Specifically, the websites of transplant hospitals can potentially be a vital source of information for those contemplating living donation. In an effort to explore the low incidence of Good Samaritan kidney donation (donations to strangers) in Australia, two raters conducted a nine-attribute website content analysis for all hospitals which participate in these transplants (n = 15). Overall, the concept of living donation is relatively silent on Australian hospital websites. Only four hospitals mention their living  donor program, and only one mentions their Good Samaritan program. No site linked directly to Australia's AKX Paired Kidney Exchange Program - the only program which facilitates pair and chain transplants in Australia. Further, information about deceased donation is nearly absent as well. An individual with the altruistic desire to donate will generally find scant or absent information about donation at the website of their local transplant hospital, although this information could easily be present as an educational tool which supports the consent process.

There were five patients whose evaluations raised possible ethical dilemmas: one had nonadherence to dialysis; two of Guyanese origin living abroad wished to have the transplant performed in Guyana; a minor wished to donate to her mother; and another subject was considering commercialization of the transplant process. RESULTS: Since inception of the renal replacement program in 2008, we have completed 13 living kidney transplantations, 17 peritoneal dialysis placements, and 20 vascular access procedures. In the five patients wherein faced ethical dilemmas, three were rejected for consideration despite having living donors: one was nonadherent, the second excluded due to an attempt to commercialize the process, and the third, a  minor who wished to donate to the mother. The other two patients were considered  Guyanese ex-patriots acceptable for the program.

684;23355225;Article;2013;Journal of medical ethics;;Elective non-therapeutic intensive care and the four principles of medical ethics.;;The chronic worldwide lack of organs for transplantation and the continuing improvement of strategies for in situ organ preservation have led to renewed interest in elective non-therapeutic ventilation of potential organ donors. Two types of situation may be eligible for elective intensive care: patients definitely evolving towards brain death and patients suitable as controlled non-heart beating organ donors after life-supporting therapies have been assessed as futile and withdrawn. Assessment of the ethical acceptability and the risks of these strategies is essential. We here offer such an ethical assessment using the four principles of medical ethics of Beauchamp and Childress applying them in their broadest sense so as to include patients and their families, their caregivers, other potential recipients of intensive care, and indeed society as a whole. The main ethical problems emerging are the definition of beneficence for the potential organ donor, the dilemma between the duty to respect a dying patient's autonomy and the duty not to harm him/her, and the possible psychological and social harm for families, caregivers other potential recipients of therapeutic intensive care, and society more generally.

Mortality of 18 existing face transplant recipients is 11.1% (2/18) through 2011. OBJECTIVE: Psychological outcomes are as important in  face transplantation as is restoring the face physically. Little quantitative information has been published this area. METHODS: Data was systematically collected over 3 years with a face transplant recipient, including appearance self-rating, body image, mood changes, pain rating, perception of teasing, quality of life, self-esteem, and social reintegration. We identified a significant gap in rating instruments for use in the field, so we developed the Perception of Teasing-FACES, Facial Anxiety Scale-State, and the Cleveland Clinic FACES score, analogous to the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score for  prioritizing patients for a face transplant registry. RESULTS: Appearance self-rating rose from 3/10 prior to transplantation to 7/10 now. Anxiety about body image and the Facial Anxiety score were halved by the end of the third year. Beck Depression Inventory fell from 16 (prior to transplant) to 8. Chronic daily  pain was 6-7/10 prior to transplant and 0/10 by day 50. Perception of Teasing-FACES scores fell from 25 to 9 by the end of year 3. Quality of life improved on the Social Environment Domain of the psychological adjustment to illness scale-self-rated (PAIS-SR), where the score dropped from 15 to 1 by the end of year 3, indicating marked improvement in social reintegration.

687;23349512;Article;2013;Journal of medical ethics;;Is it ethical to invite compatible pairs to participate in exchange programmes?;;Living kidney transplantation offers the best results for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This form of transplantation is no longer restricted to genetically or emotionally related donors, as shown by the acceptance of non-directed living anonymous donors, and the development of exchange programmes  (EPs). EPs make it possible to perform living kidney transplantation among incompatible pairs, but while such programmes can help increase living organ donation, they can also create a degree of unfairness. Kidney transplant recipients in the O blood group are at a disadvantage when it comes to EPs because they can only receive organs from O donors, whereas O donors are universal donors. This poses a major challenge in terms of distributive justice and equity. A way to remedy this situation is through altruistic unbalanced paired kidney exchange (AUPKE), in which a compatible pair consisting of an O blood group donor and a non-O recipient is invited to participate in an EP. Although the AUPKE approach appears fairer for O recipients, it still raises ethical questions. How does this type of exchange affect the donor/recipient gift relationship? Should recipients in compatible pairs receive a 'better organ' than the one they would otherwise have received from their intended donor? Finally, what is the role of transplant teams in AUPKE? This article will examine the organisational and ethical challenges associated with EPs and AUPKE, and compare  different EP policies in countries where such programmes exist.;;Fortin MC;;eng;['Altruism', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/methods', '*Living Donors', 'Resource Allocation/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/methods', 'Waiting Lists'];['Allocation of Organs/Tissues', 'Distributive Justice', 'Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues'];;Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada;10.1136/medethics-2012-101129

At present this generally involves the use of animal models which is undesirable from an ethical standpoint, requires complex and time-consuming authorization, and is very expensive. This process is exemplified in the development of hepatic ablation techniques, starting experiments on explanted livers and progressing to safety and efficacy studies in living animals prior to  clinical studies. The two main approaches used are ex vivo isolated non-perfused  liver models and in vivo animal models. Ex vivo non perfused models are less expensive, easier to obtain but not suitable to study the heat sink effect or experiments requiring several hours. In vivo animal models closely resemble clinical subjects but often are expensive and have small sample sizes due to ethical guidelines.

There are compelling arguments for maintaining  anonymity of both parties before unspecified donor transplantation and specified  indirect transplantation. After transplantation, there are still good reasons to  avoid disclosure of identities. Although anonymity could be lifted if both parties explicitly request it, there are significant, potentially negative consequences of such an approach. Both donor and recipient should be counseled regarding these, and transplant teams should consider the considerable financial  and psychosocial costs if problems are encountered as a result of contact. Given  the recent rise in the number of unspecified living-donor transplants and through paired exchange schemes, it is vital that data are collected regarding the effects of maintaining or revoking anonymity after transplantation.;;Mamode N, Lennerling A, Citterio F, Massey E, Van Assche K, Sterckx S, Frunza M, Jung H, Pascalev A, Zuidema W, Johnson R, Loven C, Weimar W, Dor FJ;;eng;['Altruism', '*Confidentiality/ethics/standards', 'Emotions', 'Gift Giving', 'Humans', 'Interpersonal Relations', '*Living Donors/ethics/psychology', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/psychology/standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic'];;;MR/J006742/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1097/TP.0b013e31827e31f7
691;23328261;Article;2013;Critical care medicine;;Systematic review of attitudes toward donation after cardiac death among healthcare providers and the general public.;;OBJECTIVE: Organ donation after cardiac death (DCD) is one promising possibility  of combating the organ shortage, but it raises ethical issues that differ from those raised in donation after brain death (DBD). Also, DCD may be perceived differently than DBD by medical staff and the public. The aim of this article is  to systematically review empirical studies on attitudes of medical personnel and  the public toward DCD and to discuss the findings from an ethical perspective. Our study was conducted in accordance with a seven-step approach for systematic reviews of empirical studies in bioethics. DATA SOURCES: The authors chose PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, and PSYNDEX, thus attempting to cover biomedical, sociological and ethical articles on the subject. STUDY SELECTION: A  search algorithm using controlled vocabulary of the respective databases (where applicable) was created, and criteria for the relevance assessment of the articles were established. Article quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The authors took  an integrative approach to the data, combining it for further analysis. Qualitative data were synthesized by means of thematic analysis, and a spectrum of relevant themes was identified. Then the authors extracted the quantitative data that corresponded with the identified themes. Quantitative data on common subjects were juxtaposed and presented later. CONCLUSIONS: Identified themes were the levels of support for DBD vs. DCD, attitudes toward postmortem measures without previous consent, lack of knowledge about DCD, concerns about the Dead Donor Rule, the potential for conflict of interest, making donation happen, and the call for standardized DCD protocols. All of these issues are of ethical relevance and merit further discussion. We conclude that deep-rooted concerns about DCD exist among medical personnel and the general public. These need to be  taken seriously in order to maintain or foster trust in the transplantation system.;;Bastami S, Matthes O, Krones T, Biller-Andorno N;;eng;['*Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Health', 'Brain Death', 'Conflict of Interest', '*Death', 'Humans', '*Public Opinion', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/CCM.0b013e31827585fe

694;23303178;Article;2013;Journal of medical ethics;;Advance statement of consent from patients with primary CNS tumours to organ donation and elective ventilation.;;A deficit in the number of organs available for transplantation persists even with an increase in donation rates. One possible choice of donor for organs that  appears under-referred and/or unaccepted is patients with primary brain tumours.  In spite of advances in the treatment of high-grade primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours, the prognosis remains dire. A working group on organs from  donors with primary CNS tumours showed that the risk of transmission is small and outweighs the benefits of waiting for a normal donor, in survival and organ life-years, with caveats. This paper explores the possibility that, if information on organ donation were made available to patients and their families  with knowledge of their inevitable fate, perhaps some will choose to donate. It would be explained that to achieve this, elective ventilation would be performed  in their final moments. This would obviate the consent question because of an advance statement. It is accepted that these are sensitive matters and there will be logistic issues. This will need discussion with the public and other professionals, but it could increase the number of donors and can be extrapolated to encompass other primary CNS tumours.;;Patel UJ;;eng;['*Advance Directives', '*Brain Neoplasms', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', '*Decision Making/ethics', 'Ethical Theory', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Public Opinion', 'Respiration, Artificial/*ethics', 'Terminal Care/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United Kingdom'];;;;10.1136/medethics-2012-100996

In the Netherlands, the Dutch Organ Donation Act allows voluntary registration. Citizens aged 12 years and older may register as organ donors of their own free will. This results in a 40 percent registration of all Dutch citizens, and may partly explain the overall shortage, which also affects parents and children with end-stage organ failure. Alternatives such as living-related donor programs have  been established as well as recruitment of child donors. A recent study evaluates the procurement of organs and tissues in pediatric intensive care units.

It is, however, limited by the scarcity of kidneys. The aim of this paper is to investigate the fairness of the priority setting process underpinning Swedish kidney transplantation in reference to the Accountability for Reasonableness (A4R) framework. METHODS: Fifteen semi-structured interviews were carried out with transplant surgeons (7), nephrologists (6) and coordinators (2) representing centers nationwide. Collected data was analysed using thematic analysis. To assess fairness in the priority setting process, identified factors were assessed in the reference to the four conditions (publicity, relevance, revision and appeal, enforcement) forming the accountability for reasonableness framework. RESULTS: Decision-making in assessment and allocation is based on clusters of factors. The factors appeal to  various values, which are balanced against each other throughout the kidney allocation process: maximizing benefit, priority to the worst off and equality. The factors described by subjects and the values on which they rest satisfy the relevance condition of the accountability for reasonableness framework. However,  two potential sources for unfair inequalities in access to treatment are identified: clinical judgment and institutional policies. CONCLUSIONS: The development of national guidelines both for assessing transplant candidacy, and for the allocation of kidneys from deceased donors, would contribute to standardize practices across centres; it will also help to better meet the conditions of fairness in reference to Accountability for Reasonableness. The benefits of this policy proposal in Swedish kidney transplantation merits consideration.";;Omar F, Tinghog G, Carlsson P, Omnell-Persson M, Welin S;;eng;['Cluster Analysis', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'Female', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Health Priorities/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Justice', 'Social Responsibility', 'Sweden', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1177/1403494812470399

It is also found that introduction of this technique would not necessitate modifications to current British legal definitions of parenthood.

Various important ethical dimensions of DCD have been considered and debated by prominent organ donation/transplantation theorists and clinicians.

700;24597424;Article;2013;The Journal of clinical ethics;;Organ donation among undocumented hispanic immigrants: an assessment of knowledge and attitudes.;;BACKGROUND: Undocumented immigrants can donate their organs, but lack access to organ transplantation.This challenges foundational principles of organ donation:  fairness and informed consent. Little is known about undocumented immigrants' knowledge of barriers to their access to organ transplantation or how this might  affect their decision to donate their organs. METHODS: The study was performed in an urban, university-affiliated, safety-net hospital.We interviewed hospitalized  patients who self-identified as undocumented immigrants and were unaware of having any contraindication to organ donation (for example, cancer). We first recorded their demographic characteristics and knowledge and attitudes regarding  organ donation. We then assessed the effects of informing participants about limits to their access to organ transplants on their willingness to donate. RESULTS: This group of 59 uninsured Hispanic immigrants had adequate knowledge about organ donation. Participants were suspicious about inequality within the medical system, but most were willing to donate their organs (74 percent). Most participants (74 percent) were aware that they would have to pay to receive an organ, but they dramatically underestimated the out-of-pocket expenses.Yet willingness to donate their organs was unaffected by participants being explicitly informed of the low likelihood that they would be able to afford to receive an organ transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being well informed about the organ donation system, undocumented Hispanic immigrants underestimate the costs and overestimate their likelihood of receiving an organ. Even when they are given this information, they remain willing to donate their own organs.;;Baru JS, Lucas BR, Martinez C, Brauner D;;eng;['Adult', 'Chicago', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', '*Emigrants and Immigrants/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology', 'Health Services Accessibility/ethics', '*Hispanic Americans/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Information Dissemination', 'Male', 'Medically Uninsured', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics', 'Sample Size', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;

It argues that among the most effective measures to prevent re-emergence of organ trafficking in the country is increasing ethical live donations and above all, establishing sustainable, public supported deceased donor programs. To do this, the transplant community must recognize that organ transplantation is not merely a donor-recipient-physician transaction but a complex issue in which decisions to donate an organ are influenced by indigenous values and belief systems about human illness, life and  death.;;Moazam F;;eng;['Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Organ Trafficking/legislation & jurisprudence/prevention & control', 'Pakistan', 'Tissue Donors'];;;;10.1007/s11019-012-9451-3

The goal of this study was to assess the opinions of U.S. transplant providers regarding the ways  in which controversial medical and psychosocial characteristics influence patient eligibility for liver transplantation. An online, anonymous survey about adult patient characteristics was sent to providers (hepatologists, surgeons, psychiatrists, and social workers) at all 102 active adult liver transplant centers in the United States. A majority of the providers (251/444 or 56.5%) completed the survey. The providers were queried about 8 characteristics, and the 3 that were ranked most controversial were incarceration, marijuana use, and psychiatric diagnoses. Most providers identified a patient age >/= 80 years (62.7%), a body mass index >/= 45 kg/m2 (56.6%), and current incarceration with a lifetime sentence (54.7%) as absolute contraindications to liver transplantation. In a multivariate analysis, the identification of absolute contraindications varied significantly with the provider type, the center volume, and the geographical region. Less than half of the providers reported that their centers  had written policies regarding most of the characteristics examined. In conclusion, providers differ significantly in their opinions on controversial patient characteristics and transplant contraindications. Along with a paucity of literature data on outcomes, these provider differences may play a role in the fact that many centers do not have formal policies for selecting patients with these characteristics. Evidence-based data on the outcomes of such patients are needed to guide the formation of written policies to better standardize eligibility criteria.;;Secunda K, Gordon EJ, Sohn MW, Shinkunas LA, Kaldjian LC, Voigt MD, Levitsky J;;eng;"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Body Mass Index', 'Contraindications', 'Decision Support Techniques', '*Eligibility Determination/ethics/standards', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation/adverse effects/ethics/standards', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Marijuana Abuse/complications', 'Marijuana Smoking/adverse effects', 'Mental Disorders/complications/psychology', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Overweight/complications/diagnosis', '*Patient Selection/ethics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'/ethics/standards"", 'Prisoners', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Young Adult']";;;;10.1002/lt.23581
705;23192569;Article;2013;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;Kidney transplant tourism: cases from Canada.;;Canada has a marked shortfall between the supply and demand for kidneys for transplantation. Median wait times for deceased donor kidney transplantation vary from 5.8 years in British Columbia, 5.2 years in Manitoba and 4.5 years in Ontario to a little over 2 years in Quebec and Nova Scotia. Living donation provides a viable option for some, but not all people. Consequently, a small number of people travel abroad to undergo kidney transplantation by commercial means. The extent to which they are aware of the potential risks to their health  and the health of the kidney vendors is unclear. Travel abroad to obtain a kidney commercially i.e. transplant tourism (TT), raises ethical issues which include the exploitation of the poor, uncertainty of donor informed consent to nephrectomy, poor clinical care and lack of follow up for the donor, commodification of the body and inequity of access to medical care for donors. Also, TT widens socioeconomic disparities in access to transplantation, differing from the Canadian system of universal coverage for healthcare. The Canadian transplant community has discussed how to respond to patients who plan to travel  abroad for TT or return with a purchased kidney. Unease rests in the tension between the duty to care for legitimate Canadian residents and the unwillingness  to enable TT. This paper discusses three anonymized cases and the Canadian responses to TT as recorded in academic literature and a formal statement by relevant professional bodies.;;Wright L, Zaltzman JS, Gill J, Prasad GV;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Canada', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation/ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', '*Medical Tourism/ethics', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Donors/ethics', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1007/s11019-012-9450-4

We explored their views about their own and the recipients' physical and psychological condition, changes in family and career dynamics, their experience  as potential or real donors, and their views about LDLT process in general. Results shed new light on the ethical grounds of LDLT and allow us to envisage new ways of improving the ethical soundness of current procedures and practices.  In particular, we argue that the purpose of an ethics committee should be to provide follow-up support for the donors rather than merely to check the freedom  of donors' consent.

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records for all eligible patients from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012 at Stollery Children's Hospital (Edmonton, Alberta) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients experienced 64 eligible hospitalizations. The mean length of stay was 326 days, corresponding to a cumulative 20,892 hospital days (57.2 patient-years). Prevalent procedures resulting in long hospitalization were long-term tracheostomy +/- ventilation in  32 (52%) patients, need for organ transplantation in 24 (39%) with completed transplantation in 15 (25%), and ventricular-assist devices (VADs) in seven (11%). Sixteen (26%) patients in the study group died, and 16 (26%) were placed in long-term care or out-of-home care at the end of their long hospitalization. Of children displaced from their family home, 14 (88%) were Aboriginal. CONCLUSION: Infants and children who experience very long hospitalizations have complex illnesses, with substantial risk for mortality and a high rate of displacement from their families after discharge.

Consequently, the scope and boundaries of this obligation can present a complex dilemma, which has  practical and moral implications, even in the world of medicine. In Jewish medical ethics, the dilemma stems from a confrontation between the duty to help others according to the biblical commandment: ""Do not stand idly by your fellow's blood"" on the one hand, and between the right and duty of man to defend himself,  which is anchored in Jewish law. This article surveys the sources of this quandary in Jewish texts throughout the ages such as the Bible, Mishnah, Talmud,  and responsa literature in various contexts. The discussion highlights the essential difference between the formal demands of the law, which protects human  rights of self-preservation, and the moral requirement to help others even if it  may include personal risk. The sources suggest distinguishing between various levels of risk ranging from high-risk to reasonable or low risk. In this way, the classic sources, provide the foundation and the tools for grappling with modern contemporary Halachic questions such as organ transplantation, and generate a Torah value-based framework to deal with new situations that may arise in the future.

The history of the Italian Code of Medical Deontology dates back to the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1903  it appeared in the form of a ""Code of Ethics and Deontology"" and was prepared by  the Board of the Medical Register of Sassari (Sardinia). This Board inserted the  principles inspiring the correct practice of the medical profession in an articulated and self-normative system, also foreseeing disciplinary measures. About ten years later, in 1912, the Medical Register of Turin (Piedmont) elaborated a Code which constituted the basis for a subsequent elaboration leading to a Unified Code of Medical Ethics (1924). After World War II the idea prevailed in Italy that the codes of medical deontology should undergo periodical review, updating and dissemination, and the new 1947 text (Turin) was for the first time amply diffused among Italian physicians. The next national code dates  back to 1958, and twenty years later a revision was published. In the 1989 Code new topics appeared, including organ transplantation, artificial in vitro insemination and the role of police doctors; these and other issues were later developed in the 1995, 1998 and 2006 versions of the Code.

Should this kind of transplantation prove routine and effective for those women, would there be any morally significant reason why men or transgender women should not be eligible for the same opportunity for gestation? Getting to the point of safe and effective uterus transplantation for those parties would require a focused line of research, over and above the study of uterus transplantation for non-transgender women. Some commentators object to the idea that the state has any duty to sponsor research of this kind. They would limit all publicly-funded fertility research to sex-typical ways of having children, which they construe as the basis of reproductive rights. This objection has no force against privately-funded research, of course, and in any case not all social expenditures are responses to 'rights' properly speaking. Another possible objection raised against gestation by transgender women is that it could alter the social meaning of sexed bodies. This line of argument fails, however, to substantiate a meaningful objection to gestation by transgender women because social meanings of sexed bodies do not remain constant and because the change in  this case would not elicit social effects significant enough to justify closing off gestation to transgender women as a class.;;Murphy TF;;eng;['Biomedical Research/*economics/ethics', 'Female', '*Financing, Government/economics/ethics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Pregnancy/*ethics', '*Reproductive Rights', '*Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/economics/ethics', 'Research Support as Topic/*ethics', 'Social Values', '*Transgender Persons', 'Uterus/*surgery'];['assisted gestation', 'ethics', 'transgenderism', 'uterus transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12132

However, the clinical use of allogeneic transplantation is limited by the growing shortage of human organs. This has prompted us to initiate a unique multi-center and multi-team effort to promote translational research in xenotransplantation to bring xenotransplantation to the clinical setting. Supported by the German Research Foundation, an interdisciplinary group of surgeons, internal medicine doctors, diabetologists, material sciences experts, immunologists, cell biologists, virologists, veterinarians, and geneticists have established a collaborative research center (CRC) focusing on the biology of xenogeneic cell, tissue, and organ transplantation. A major strength of this consortium is the inclusion of members of the regulatory bodies, including the Paul-Ehrlich Institute (PEI), infection specialists from the Robert Koch Institute and PEI, veterinarians from  the German Primate Center, and representatives of influential ethical and religious institutions. A major goal of this consortium is to promote islet xenotransplantation, based on the extensive expertise and experience of the existing clinical islet transplantation program. Besides comprehensive approaches to understand and prevent inflammation-mediated islet xenotransplant dysfunction  [immediate blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR)], we also take advantage  of the availability of and experience with islet macroencapsulation, with the goal to improve graft survival and function. This consortium harbors a unique group of scientists with complementary expertise under a cohesive program aiming  at developing new therapeutic approaches for islet replacement and solid organ xenotransplantation.;;Reichart B, Niemann H, Chavakis T, Denner J, Jaeckel E, Ludwig B, Marckmann G, Schnieke A, Schwinzer R, Seissler J, Tonjes RR, Klymiuk N, Wolf E, Bornstein SR;;eng;['Animals', 'Cells, Immobilized/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Islets of Langerhans/*cytology', '*Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/immunology', 'Sus scrofa', '*Transplantation, Heterologous'];;;;10.1055/s-0034-1395518
717;25498104;Article;2014;Transplantation proceedings;;Features and ethical considerations associated with living kidney and liver transplantations in South Korea.;;When the Organ Transplantation Act came into effect in 2000 in South Korea, living organ donations were legalized and the Korean Network for Organ Sharing (KONOS) had a duty to approve the application of donation. The number of living organ donors has increased and the waiting time of recipients has been steady or  decreased. The Organ Transplantation Act mainly focuses on the informed consent process of donations, so unrelated directed donations are permitted unless there  is a suspicion of organ trafficking. But the annual reports show that directed donations of unrelated and related donors may have an ethical concern about organ sales. The donations of family members show another ethical concern. The numbers  of ABO-incompatible transplantations have steadily increased since 2008, and lineal descendants, including minors, comprised 61% of living liver donors in 2012. Addressing the unethical practices without inhibiting living organ donations is the current task in South Korea. Private agencies have actively operated the living organ donations programs. The web-based computerized organ exchange program has been cooperatively run by hospital-based organizations. The  strict legal regulations that could decrease living organ donations are hard to adopt. In the current situation, the functions of the official system need to be  more developed. A national organ exchange program run by KONOS could be an option which could reduce ABO-incompatible transplantations and relieve the ethical concern of organ sales in unrelated directed donations.;;Kim JH;;eng;['Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Morals', 'Republic of Korea'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.09.154

METHOD: A cross-sectional survey study was performed that included 45 families of brain-dead donors in 1 hospital-based organ procurement organization (HOPO) in Korea between February 2007 and April 2011. RESULTS: Donor willingness and desire in life was the most frequent reason organs were donated (34.5%), followed by the advice of family members or friends (31.0%). Satisfaction with the organ donation processes was 4.04 of 6 points. In  each category, the satisfaction with the decision of donation was the highest (4.96 points) and the satisfaction with the procedure of donation was the lowest  (3.07 points); of each question, the satisfaction of ""information and help on funeral arrangements was enough"" and ""the process of preparing the relevant documents was cumbersome"" was the lowest. ""Missing"" the dead person and ""pride"" were the most common emotions experienced after organ donation (69.0% and 62.1%,  respectively), followed by ""grief,"" ""family coherence,"" and ""guilt."" Religious practices were observed to be most helpful for psychological stress relief after  donation, followed by spending time with family and friends. Moreover, 24.1% responded that they had not yet overcome their suffering. CONCLUSION: Because donors' own willingness is the most common reason that families choose donation,  it is necessary to remind the public of the importance of organ donation through  education and public relations using mass communication approaches. Additionally, because the families felt grief and guilt as well as missing their loved ones and pride regarding their dead loved ones after organ donation, continuous and systematic supports are needed to promote their psychological stability.";;Kim HS, Yoo YS, Cho OH;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Death', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Emotions', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Personal Satisfaction', 'Republic of Korea', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.09.094

In some key areas such as liver, lung, and kidney transplants, Chinese transplant success rates are similar to the rates in developed countries. Organ donation also has developed rapidly. However, China is facing a serious organ shortage that restricts clinical treatment and medical research. This shortage is due to imperfect laws and improper management of organ donation, as well as Chinese traditional ethics. Finding an efficient way to make the number of donated organs keep pace with the need for organ transplants and to optimize allocation of organ resources is a long-term and arduous task. In some ways, Chinese organ donation nowadays is constrained more by legal issues than by medical issues.

The Welsh Assembly last year passed legislation to enable the introduction of presumed consent in Wales in 2015. The issue is currently being discussed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. However, there is scant evidence that presumed consent will be effective. Rather than legislating for consent of donors, we should be addressing the misgivings and misunderstandings of families to improve their consent rate, as has been done so successfully in Spain. National improvements in infrastructure in the UK have resulted in an outstanding 63% increase in deceased donation since 2007. If, now, family consent rates could be improved from the current 57% to Spanish levels of 85%, the UK's donation rate would be one of the  best in the world.;;Fabre J;;eng;['Humans', '*Presumed Consent/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data', 'United Kingdom'];['Organ Donation Taskforce', 'Presumed consent', 'organ donation', 'transplantation'];;;10.7861/clinmedicine.14-6-567

With modern medical advances, however, more precise answers are looked for. For a definition of death to succeed is important that it is a universal definition and that under it, all human beings are correctly identified as alive or dead. This article initially examines the most commonly proposed positions on when a human being dies those of cardiopulmonary death, whole brain death, brainstem death and higher brain death and for each describes scenarios that provide counter-intuitive results. Intuition is used as a benchmark as this is what our patients most commonly use. The second part of the article seeks to establish a more robust definition of death. We argue that death is an event that takes place at a set point in time, when the collection of bodily processes that maintains homoeostasis finally cease. Based upon defining 'human being' as being in possession of human DNA and Olsen's Animalism, the model is applicable to a full  lifespan and maintains personal identity throughout the course of life. That this conclusion will interfere with clinical practice concerning organ transplantation is considered, but countered with the argument that there has been a conflation of the normative question of timing of organ retrieval for transplantation with the metaphysical question of what is death.;;Schofield GM, Urch CE, Stebbing J, Giamas G;;eng;['Brain Death/diagnosis', '*Death', 'Humans', 'Life', 'Personhood', 'Terminology as Topic'];;;14549/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom;10.1093/qjmed/hcu239

729;25407504;Article;2014;Critical care (London, England);;Chloride-liberal fluids are associated with acute kidney injury after liver transplantation.;;INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently after liver transplantation and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence has linked the predominant usage of 'chloride-liberal' intravenous fluids, such as 0.9% saline to the development of renal dysfunction in general critically ill patients. We compared the effects of perioperative fluid types on AKI in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: An observational analysis of liver transplant recipients over a 33-month period, between January 2010 and September 2013, was performed. Intensive care unit database and patient  records were analyzed for determinants of early postoperative AKI. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was carried out using a two-tailed P value less  than 0.05 to establish significance. The institutional Research Ethics Committee  approved the study methodology (RAC no. 2131 073). RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight liver transplants were performed, AKI developed in 57 (36.1%) patients: 39 (68.4%) fully recovered, 13 (22.8%) developed chronic renal failure  and 10 (17.5%) required long-term hemodialysis. On univariate regression analysis, AKI was significantly associated with greater than 3,200 ml of chloride-liberal fluids infused within the first postoperative day (HR 5.9, 95% CI 2.64, 13.2, P < 0.001), greater than 1,500 ml colloids received in the operating room (hazard ratio (HR) 1.97, 95% CI 1.01, 3.8, P = 0.046), vasopressor requirement for 48 hours posttransplant (HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.55, 7.21, P = 0.002),  hyperchloremia at day 2 (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01, 1.18, P = 0.015) and preoperative  model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03, 1.13, P < 0.001). After stepwise multivariate regression, infusion of greater than 3,200 ml of chloride-liberal fluids (HR 6.25, 95% CI 2.69, 14.5, P < 0.000) and preoperative MELD score (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02, 1.15, P = 0.004) remained significant predictors for AKI.

731;25378550;Article;2015;Journal of medical ethics;;Coercion and choice in parent-child live kidney donation.;;This paper explores whether donor-parents felt coerced to donate a kidney to their child. There is a paucity of UK literature on parental live kidney donors and the voluntariness of their decision-making. Data were gathered as part of a study exploring parental experiences of consenting for live donation at a UK specialist children's hospital. Parents who donated a kidney to their child between September 2006 and December 2010 and who consented at their child's hospital to be referred to an adult unit for consideration for live donation were invited to participate. Of the 19 eligible parents, seven fathers and three mothers consented to be interviewed. Their primary motivation for donation was being a parent (more specifically, the parent of a sick child). Participants expressed this in terms of parental love and concern. Participants conveyed certainty about their decision and viewed live donation as a positive opportunity. Most participants regarded the decision to donate, or not donate, as one every parent is entitled to make for their own reasons. In discussing our findings, we argue that when parents do not separate their child's interests from their own, this does not necessarily compromise autonomous decision-making: using one's own moral values to constrain one's own choices can be compatible with voluntary decision-making. Indeed, choices may be more constrained when parents are unable to donate, because this reduces the options available to parents to help their child.;;Burnell P, Hulton SA, Draper H;;eng;['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Choice Behavior/*ethics', '*Coercion', 'Decision Making/ethics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', '*Living Donors', 'Male', '*Motivation', 'Narration', '*Parents/psychology', '*Personal Autonomy', 'United Kingdom', 'Volition'];['Autonomy', 'Coercion', 'Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues', 'Family', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1136/medethics-2013-101988

734;25373855;Article;2014;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Hand transplants and the mandate for tolerance.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The field of vascularized composite allograft (VCA) to achieve its full potential will require induction of tolerance. This review will introduce a new method of potential inducing tolerance in hand transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Hand transplantation is never a life-extending transplant. This  fact resulted in considerable debate both for and against the use of immunosuppression for nonlife-extending transplants. There is considerable debate about the ethics of hand transplantation. There is now consensus that nonlife-extending transplants are acceptable in properly selected patients. However, ideally, hand transplants should not receive life-long immunosuppression. Therefore, attempts to achieve drug-free tolerance through nonlife-endangering therapies are warranted. To this end, we propose implementation of tolerizing therapy long after periinflammation has subsided and drug minimization has proven successful. Evidence that short-term treatment with  low doses of IL-2 or a long-lived IL-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) can tilt the balance of immunity from tissue destructive to tolerance come from preclinical demonstrations in mouse and nonhuman primate models of autoimmunity and/or transplantation and even more recent clinical trials. SUMMARY: We believe that with the proper use of low-dose IL-2 given at an opportune time in the inflammatory process of transplant that reduce immunosuppression and even tolerance can be induced in hand transplantation. We propose that tolerance can be inducted after a long period of conventional treatment to avoid 'tolerance-hindering' adverse inflammation that occurs in the posttransplant period. With abatement of posttransplant inflammation and with time, we will institute low-dose IL-2-based therapy to support the proliferation, viability and functional phenotype of regulatory T cells.;;Koulmanda M, Pomahac B, Fan Z, Murphy GF, Strom TB;;eng;['Animals', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', '*Hand Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology'];;;U01 AI102427/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000138

We sought to determine what potential living kidney donors are told about their ability to opt out, alibi availability and postwithdrawal confidentiality. We reviewed 148 consent forms for living kidney donor evaluation from US transplant centres that performed >5 living kidney transplants in 2010-2011 (response rate 87%). We found that while 98% of centres used evaluation consent forms that indicated that the donor could  withdraw, only 21% of these documents offered an alibi. Another 23% of centres' consent forms indicated that the transplant team would be willing to inform the intended recipient that an individual was not a potential donor. Relatively few consent documents explicitly addressed the confidentiality of the donor's health  information (31%), candidacy status (18%), decision (24%) or reasons (23%) following withdrawal. To preserve potential donors' autonomy and relationships, we advocate that all transplant centres offer general alibis in their evaluation  consent forms.

736;25350176;Article;2014;Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England;;Hand transplant surgery.;;In September 1998 the world's first hand transplant was performed in Lyon, France. A new era in reconstructive surgery had begun. This case highlighted the  potential for composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA). While CTA is not a new  technique, it unifies the principles of reconstructive microsurgery and transplant surgery, achieving the goals of absolute correction of a defect with anatomically and physiologically identical tissue with none of the issues of donor site morbidity associated with autologous tissue transfer. The adoption of  this technique for non-life threatening conditions to improve quality of life has generated a number of new ethical considerations. Additionally, the prominence of transplanted hands has led to much discussion around the issue of body identity and psychological assessment of potential recipients.

Margaret Sinsbury had died in Guy's Hospital, after which her heart was removed and transplanted. This, the third British heart transplant, crystallized the deep concerns that were by then swirling around the  wider transplant enterprise, notably whether the people from whom organs were being taken were dead or had been made so. Yet a year earlier, to reassure the public in this regard, a formula had been devised at the U.K. Health Ministries'  MacLennan Conference to enable death to be certified based on cerebral rather than cardiac indicators. This was the first such formula in the English-speaking  world, and it included safeguards to protect the interests of dying patients who  were considered to be potential organ donors. However, the third British heart transplant revealed these protections to be a chimera, and brought such operations there to a halt for a decade.";;Macdonald H;;eng;['Ethics, Medical/*history', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation/ethics/*history/standards', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'London'];;;;10.1353/bhm.2014.0053

Appropriate choice of conservative care for  children in end-stage renal disease: an ethical framework.;;Due to technological advances, an increasing number of infants and children are surviving with multi-organ system dysfunction, and some are reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Many have quite limited life expectancies and may not be eligible for kidney transplantation but families request dialysis as alternative. In developed countries where resources are available there is often uncertainty by the medical team as to what should be done. After encountering several of these scenarios, we developed an ethical decision-making framework for the appropriate choice of conservative care or renal replacement therapy in infants and children with ESRD. The framework is a practical tool to help determine if the burdens of dialysis would outweigh the benefits for a particular patient and  family. It is based on the four topics approach of medical considerations, quality-of-life determinants, patient and family preferences and contextual features tailored to pediatric ESRD. In this article we discuss the basis of the  criteria, provide a practical framework to guide these difficult conversations, and illustrate use of the framework with a case example. While further research is needed, through this approach we hope to reduce the moral distress of care providers and staff as well as potential conflict with the family in these complex decision-making situations.;;Dionne JM, d'Agincourt-Canning L;;eng;['Advance Care Planning/*ethics', 'Child', '*Decision Making', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality/psychology/*therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Renal Dialysis/*ethics/psychology', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Withholding Treatment/ethics'];;;;10.1007/s00467-014-2977-2

Hence, killing patients who are already totally disabled is not wrong. I maintain that their notion of total disability is ambiguous and that they beg the question with respect to whether there are abilities left over that remain relevant for the goods of personhood and human worth. If these goods remain, then something more is lost in death than in 'total disability,' and their explanation of what makes killing wrong comes up short.

We hypothesized that centers that received low performance (LP) evaluations were more likely to alter protocols, resulting in reduced rates of transplants and patients placed on the waiting list. We evaluated the association of LP evaluations and transplant activity among liver transplant centers in the United States using national Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data (January 2007 to July 2012). We compared the average change in recipient and candidate volume and donor and patient characteristics based on whether the centers received LP evaluations. Of 92 eligible centers, 27 (29%) received at least one LP evaluation. Centers without an LP evaluation (n = 65) had an average increase of 9.3 transplants and 14.9 candidates while LP centers had an average decrease of 39.9 transplants (p < 0.01) and 67.3 candidates (p < 0.01). LP centers reduced the use of older donors, donations with longer cold ischemia, and donations after cardiac death (p-values  < 0.01). There was no association between the change in transplant volume and measured performance (R(2) = 0.002, p = 0.91).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After study approval by the local ethics committee, all participants provided written informed consent. Included were 118 participants (58 LT recipients [mean age, 46.8 years +/- 1.9; 30 women, 28 men] and 60 control participants [mean age, 39.9 years +/- 1.9; 41 women, 19 men]) between April 2010 and May 2012. HR peripheral quantitative CT of the ultradistal radius was performed and evaluated for bone mineral density and trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture. Mechanical competence was quantified by microfinite element analysis. Differences between LT recipients and control participants were determined by using two-way factorial analysis of covariance with age adjustment. RESULTS: Total and trabecular bone mineral density were significantly lower (-13.4% and -16.4%, respectively; P = .001) in LT recipients than in healthy control participants. LT recipients had lower trabecular number (-9.7%; P = .004) and lower trabecular thickness (-8.1%; P = .025). Trabecular separation and trabecular network heterogeneity were higher (+24.3% and +63.9%, respectively; P  = .007 and P = .012, respectively) in LT recipients. Moreover, there was pronounced cortical porosity (+31.3%; P = .035) and lower cortical thickness (-10.2%, P = .005) after LT. In addition, mechanical competence was impaired, which was reflected by low stiffness (-15.0%; P < .001), low failure force (-14.8%; P < .001), and low bone strength (-14.6%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Men and women with recent LT showed severe deficits in cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture. Poor bone microarchitecture and low bone strength are likely to contribute to high fracture susceptibility observed in LT recipients.";;Fischer L, Valentinitsch A, DiFranco MD, Schueller-Weidekamm C, Kienzl D, Resch H, Gross T, Weber M, Jaksch P, Klepetko W, Zweytick B, Pietschmann P, Kainberger F, Langs G, Patsch JM;;eng;['Adult', '*Bone Density', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Porosity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radius/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods'];;;;10.1148/radiol.14140201

Clinical obstetrics & gynaecology;;Infertility and ART after transplantation.;;Organ transplantation (OT) has improved the long-term survival of patients facing specific organ failure and has refocused management to a chronic condition, with  emphasis on enhancing life quality, including respecting a patient's autonomy to  have children. Transplant patients are often faced with subfertility, frequently  a consequence of gonadotoxic medical therapy. For some patients, successful OT management, reproductive conservation measures and the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may help preserve fertility. There is a growing literature on the use of ART in these patients. The main objective of ART in OT recipients is attaining a healthy pregnancy, while minimizing potential complications that would jeopardize both the maternal health status and offspring. The purpose of this article is to address the distinctive medical, ethical and psychosocial concerns surrounding the fertility management of OT recipients.;;De Pinho JC, Sauer MV;;eng;['Female', 'Fertility Preservation/ethics', 'Fertilization in Vitro/ethics', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression/adverse effects', 'Infertility/chemically induced/*therapy', 'Male', '*Organ Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', '*Pregnancy, High-Risk', 'Quality of Life', '*Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/ethics', 'Time Factors'];['ART', 'IVF', 'fertility preservation', 'organ transplant', 'recipients', 'reproduction'];;;10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2014.07.017

Lovette's death, in 2006, that I discovered that the twenty-four-year-old colleague and friend with whom I had spent so many afternoons debating issues in organ transplantation had been the first successful child heart transplantee in the world and one of the longest-living survivors of  a second transplant. During the years we met, he never even hinted at the fact that three different hearts had beaten in his chest. The revelation that his life had been an almost uninterrupted chain of medical challenges suddenly made me appreciate his quirkiness in a whole new light. Organ transplantation crudely exemplifies a traditional moral dilemma between means and ends: in order to save  a life, someone else has to die. Bioethicists involved in this field have the role of identifying the ethical issues surrounding organ donation and helping others to argue in an intelligible and convincing way. In my view, bioethicists have the obligation to foster a discussion as open and transparent as possible on these matters. Still, I sometimes fear that I may be helping to cause unnecessary harms to potential recipients who are desperately waiting for a vital organ. Scholars would be chillingly cold if their quest for truth systematically came at the cost of lives lost. Every life can be meaningful and provide meaning to many  others.

759;25227276;Article;2014;Theoretical medicine and bioethics;;A phenomenological approach to the ethics of transplantation medicine: sociality  and sharing when living-with and dying-with others.;;Recent years have seen a rise in the number of sociological, anthropological, and ethnological works on the gift metaphor in organ donation contexts, as well as in the number of philosophical and theological analyses of giving and generosity, which has been mirrored in the ethical debate on organ donation. In order to capture the breadth of this field, four frameworks for thinking about bodily exchanges in medicine have been distinguished: property rights, heroic gift-giving, sacrifice, and gift-giving as aporia. Unfortunately, they all run into difficulties in terms of both making sense of the relational dimensions of postmortem and live organ donations and being normatively adequate in the sense of shedding light and providing guidance on ethical concerns when body parts are  donated. For this reason, this article presents a phenomenological framework of giving-through-sharing, based on Maurice Merleau-Ponty's philosophy. This framework makes sense of relational dimensions of postmortem and live organ donation. It also sheds light on three highly debated concerns in organ donation  ethics: indebtedness on the part of recipients, the fact that some live donors do not experience donation as a matter of choice, and the potentially painful experience of donors' relatives, who need to make decisions about postmortem organ donation at a time of bereavement. It can indirectly support what may be called a normalization of bodily exchanges in medicine.;;Zeiler K;;eng;['Coercion', 'Family', '*Human Body', 'Humans', '*Living Donors', '*Morals', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Philosophy', 'Social Justice', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1007/s11017-014-9307-3

The data show that significant inequities of access to KTx are persistent, localized to one of the state's three DSAs and disproportionately affect Hispanics as well as counties with lower median family incomes. Imbalances in determinants of supply and demand, discordance between DSAs of residence versus listing and ALU dispositions dating to the 1990s were identified as underlying causes.

However, long-term survival has not been assessed and emphasizing the 1-year survival metric may actually sustain 1-year survival while not reflecting worsening longer-term survival. Therefore, we assessed overall and conditional 1-year survival; and the effect of crossing the 1-year threshold on hazard of death in three temporal cohorts: historical (1995-2000), pre-LAS (2001-2005) and post-LAS (2005-2010). One-year survival post-LAS remained similar to pre-LAS (83.1% vs. 82.1%) and better than historical controls (75%). Overall survival in the pre- and post-LAS  cohorts was also similar. However, long-term survival among patients surviving beyond 1 year was worse than pre-LAS and similar to historical controls. Also, the hazard of death increased significantly in months 13 (1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.87) and 14 (1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.87) post-LAS but not in the other cohorts. While implementation of the LAS has not reduced overall survival, decreased survival among patients surviving beyond 1 year in the post-LAS cohort and the increased mortality occurring immediately after 1 year suggest a potential negative long-term effect of the LAS and an unintended consequence of increased emphasis on the 1-year survival metric.";;Maxwell BG, Levitt JE, Goldstein BA, Mooney JJ, Nicolls MR, Zamora M, Valentine V, Weill D, Dhillon GS;;eng;['Cohort Studies', '*Health Care Rationing', 'Humans', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Survival Rate'];['Clinical research/practice', 'Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients (SRTR)', 'ethics', 'health services and outcomes research', 'lung transplantation/pulmonology', 'organ allocation', 'organ transplantation in general', 'patient survival', 'risk assessment/risk stratification', 'social sciences'];;K25 DK097279/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.12903

Two medical school clinicians designed a telemedicine session linking their facilities (across 2 continents). The session, Exploring the Patient Experience Through Telemedicine: Dialysis and End-Stage Renal Disease, allowed second-year medical students to explore various parameters of quality of  life experienced by dialysis patients. A panel of 4 medical students interviewed  a dialysis patient via Skype video connection between the medical school and the  hospital's dialysis unit. Interview questions were adapted from the Kidney Disease Quality of Life instrument. During the live video-streamed interview, the remaining 23 second-year medical students observed the session. Afterward, the 23 were offered a voluntary anonymous online feedback survey (15 responded). The 4 panelists submitted narrative responses to 2 open-ended questions about their experience.

766;25160968;Article;2014;Indian journal of medical ethics;;Deceased organ donation in India: where do we go from here?;;Transplantation represents one of the best examples of the scientific achievements of medical science. However, its success has also led to some of the fiercest ethical challenges in modern medicine. Partly as a response to the uncovering of a flourishing clandestine kidney trade, the Central government promulgated the Human Organs Transplant Act (HOTA) in 1994. HOTA, along with its  amendments, was a step forward in recognising concepts such as brain death. Nevertheless, there are numerous ethical challenges still to be resolved, particularly with regard to consent, incentives to donors and families, and equitable distribution of donated organs.;;Nagral S, Amalorpavanathan J;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Cadaver', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'India', 'Motivation', 'Organ Trafficking/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/organization & administration/trends'];;;;10.20529/IJME.2014.043

Yet, despite the phenomenal gains, several challenges remain  in this area. For example, robust and sustainable deceased donor programmes must  be established to meet the needs of a country which has a high prevalence of kidney disease and failure. Further, it is necessary to offer an alternative source of organs for transplantation to desperate patients who resort to buying these from the ""market"". Cultural factors and religious beliefs about the sanctity and inviolability of the corpse, as well as the lack of public and professional education regarding the procurement of organs from the deceased, pose considerable barriers that must be surmounted. We believe it is equally important that transplant professionals and the governments of affluent countries consider measures to discourage, if not prevent, their citizens from travelling to impoverished countries such as Pakistan to buy organs. Without a commitment, ethical and legal, to international solidarity in this matter, the goals that are already difficult for developing countries to achieve, ie, establishing deceased  donor programmes and bringing an end to organ trafficking, will be even harder to achieve.";;Moazam F, Jafarey A;;eng;['*Commerce/ethics', '*Cultural Characteristics', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', '*Medical Tourism/trends', 'Organ Trafficking/*prevention & control/trends', 'Pakistan', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/trends'];;;;10.20529/IJME.2014.042

It began with both living related donor (LRD) and deceased donor (DD) transplants. Over the next nine years, while the LRD programme progressed relatively well, there were only thirteen DD transplants. Two of the DD kidneys were obtained from overseas via an active collaboration with the Euro-transplant organisation, and one DD kidney was obtained from Saudi Arabia within the Gulf Cooperative Council exchange programme. The rest of the DD kidneys were obtained in Oman. The Omani DD programme, although it was a pioneering effort in the Gulf region at the time, was not entirely sustainable. In this paper we focus on the challenges we encountered. Among the major challenges was the absence of resources to establish a dedicated DD programme and particularly the failure to develop a cadre of dedicated transplant coordinators.;;Mohsin N, Al-Busaidy Q, Al-Marhuby H, Al-Lawati J, Daar AS;;eng;['Brain Death/*diagnosis', '*Cadaver', '*Commerce', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors', 'Oman', 'Program Development', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/organization & administration/trends'];;;;10.20529/IJME.2014.041

770;25160964;Article;2014;Indian journal of medical ethics;;Organ donation in the Philippines: should the dead do more?;;This paper asks whether the Philippines should focus on ways of dealing with end-stage renal disease by getting more transplantable kidneys from the dead. Would it be more ethical to put the burden to donate on the dead (who have already lost their chance to consent) than on the living (who can consent)? Given the risks involved in undergoing nephrectomy and the lack of benefits arising from the procedure to donors, the dead should be the first to put their kidneys on the line. In the Philippines, unfortunately, living donors have had to bear the greater burden in this regard. Starting with a brief account of developments  surrounding the impact of the Declaration of Istanbul on the situation in the Philippines as well as in other countries, the paper examines what the living have been expected to do, what they have actually done, and what lessons the experience with living donors offers for the understanding of cadaver transplants. The paper then looks at possible ways of increasing the sources of kidneys for transplantation and asks if these ways could be implemented successfully and ethically in the Philippines.;;de Castro LD;;eng;['Cadaver', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', '*Living Donors', 'Medical Tourism/trends', 'Organ Trafficking/*legislation & jurisprudence/*trends', 'Philippines', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/trends'];;;;10.20529/IJME.2014.039

However, the risk factors for and the impact of UTIs remain controversial. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of posttransplant UTIs in a series of renal transplant recipients from deceased donors. Secondary objectives were to identify: (1) the most frequent infectious agents; (2) risk factors related to donor; (3) risk factors related to recipients; and (4) impact of UTI on graft function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of medical records from renal transplant patients from January to December 2010. Local ethics committee approved the protocol. RESULTS: The incidence of UTI in this series was 34.2%. Risk factors for UTI were older age, (independent of gender), biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes, and kidneys from deceased donors (United Network for Organ Sharing criteria). For female patients, the number of pretransplant pregnancies was an additional risk factor. Recurrent UTI was observed in 44% of patients from the UTI group. The most common infectious agents were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, for both isolated and recurrent UTI. No difference in renal graft function or immunosuppressive therapy was observed between groups after the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, older age, previous pregnancy, kidneys from expanded criteria donors, and biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes were risk factors for posttransplant UTI.

The main goal is to transplant an organ in conditions as close as possible to its physiological live state. ""Elective ventilation"" (EV), that is, the use of ventilation for the sole purpose of retrieving the organs of patients close to death, is an option which offsets the shortage of organ donation. We have analyzed the legal context of the dying process of the organ donor and the feasibility of EV in the Italian context. There is no legal framework regulating the practice of EV, neither is any real information given to the general public. A public debate has yet to be initiated. In the Italian cultural and legislative scenario, we believe that, under some circumstances (i.e., the expressed wishes of the patient, even in the form of advance directives), the use of EV does not violate the principle of beneficence.

The most common postoperative complications are infection, acute graft rejection, and acute renal failure. To prevent complications, recipients are treated with immunosuppressive medications and anti-infective agents. The long-term complications of liver transplantation are a consequence of long-term use of immunosuppressive medications and recurrence of the original disease in the liver.

Questions regarding motivation and characteristics of these donors persist, alongside concerns about regret and long-term psychosocial outcomes. The aims of this study were to compare psychosocial and physical outcomes in unspecified kidney donors (UKDs) versus specified kidney donors (SKDs). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study, in which a detailed assessment of psychosocial outcomes was made using validated questionnaires. Additional questions specific to donation were also asked, including questions regarding motivation, regret, and anonymity. RESULTS: One hundred ninety responses were received from 296 participants studied (110 UKDs [74.3%] vs. 80 SKDs [54.1%], P<0.001). Unspecified kidney donors were older (54 years vs. 44 years; P<0.001), predominantly white (99.1% vs. 78.5%; P<0.001), and donated more recently (1.3 years vs. 2.6 years; P<0.001). There was no difference in psychiatric history or personality type, or current depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, or well-being between the groups (P>0.05). Unspecified kidney donors were more engaged in other altruistic behaviours (P<0.001). There was no difference in physical outcomes, although UKDs recovered quicker (P<0.001). Regret was low (3.7% UKDs vs. 7.5% SKDs; P=0.078). CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that UKDs have comparable physical and psychosocial outcomes to SKDs. These favorable outcomes may be, in part, because of the rigorous evaluation process which currently includes a mental health assessment.

789;24997006;Article;2014;Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association;;Patient attitudes towards kidney transplant listing: qualitative findings from the ATTOM study.;;BACKGROUND: There is variation in time to listing and rates of listing for transplantation between renal units in the UK. While research has mainly focused  on healthcare organization, little is known about patient perspectives of entry onto the transplant waiting list. This qualitative study aimed to explore patients' views and experiences of kidney transplant listing. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients aged under 75, who were on dialysis and on the transplant waiting list, not on the waiting list, undergoing assessment for listing or who had received a transplant. Patients were recruited from a purposive sample of nine UK renal units, which included transplanting and non-transplanting units and units with high and low wait-listing patterns. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (5-7 per renal unit) were interviewed. Patients reported that they had received little information about the listing process. Some patients did not know if they were listed or had found  they were not listed when they had thought they were on the list. Others expressed distress when they felt they had been excluded from potential listing based on age and/or comorbidity and felt the process was unfair. Many patients were not aware of pre-emptive transplantation and believed they had to be on dialysis before being able to be listed. There was some indication that pre-emptive transplantation was discussed more often in transplant than non-transplant units. Lastly, some patients were reluctant to consider family members as potential donors as they reported they would feel 'guilty' if the donor suffered subsequent negative effects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest a need  to review current practice to further understand individual and organizational reasons for the renal unit variation identified in patient understanding of transplant listing. The communication of information warrants attention to ensure patients are fully informed about the listing process and opportunity for pre-emptive transplantation in a way that is meaningful and understandable to them.;;Calestani M, Tonkin-Crine S, Pruthi R, Leydon G, Ravanan R, Bradley JA, Tomson CR, Forsythe JL, Oniscu GC, Bradley C, Cairns J, Dudley C, Watson C, Draper H, Johnson RJ, Metcalfe W, Fogarty DG, Roderick P;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', '*Attitude to Health', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/psychology/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Physician-Patient Relations', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United Kingdom', '*Waiting Lists', 'Young Adult'];['information provision', 'kidney transplant listing', 'patient perspective.', 'patient-clinician communication'];;MR/K012126/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;10.1093/ndt/gfu188

This would have  the advantage of both addressing the grave shortage of organs available for transplantation and respecting the freedom of individuals to choose to do whatever they want with their body parts. The old arguments against such a market in human organs are, therefore, being brought back into question. The article examines the different arguments both in favour and against the sale of human organs. It concludes that the body and any of its elements is a full expression of the whole person. As such, they cannot have a price if the individual is to retain his or her full inherent dignity and if society is to retain and protect this very important concept.;;MacKellar C;;eng;['*Commodification', 'Developing Countries', 'Freedom', '*Health Care Sector/economics/ethics', '*Human Body', 'Human Rights', 'Humans', '*Organ Trafficking/economics/ethics', '*Personhood', '*Poverty', '*Tissue Donors/ethics/psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/ethics'];;;;10.1179/2050287714z.00000000043

792;24953161;Article;2015;Developing world bioethics;;Ethics and Rationing Access to Dialysis in Resource-Limited Settings: The Consequences of Refusing a Renal Transplant in the South African State Sector.;;Resource constraints in developing countries compel policy makers to ration the provision of healthcare services. This article examines one such set of Guidelines: A patient dialysing in the state sector in South Africa may not refuse renal transplantation when a kidney becomes available. Refusal of transplantation can lead to exclusion from the state-funded dialysis programme. This Guideline is legally acceptable as related to Constitutional stipulations which allow for rationing healthcare resources in South Africa. Evaluating the ethical merit of the Guideline, and exploring the ethical dilemma it poses, proves a more complex task. We examine the actions of healthcare professionals as constrained by the Guideline. From a best interests framework, we argue that in these circumstances directing patient decision making (pressurising a patient to  undergo renal transplantation) is not necessarily unethical or unacceptably paternalistic. We then scrutinise the guideline itself through several different  ethical 'lenses'. Here, we argue that bioethics does not provide a definitive answer as to the moral merit of rationing dialysis under these circumstances, however it can be considered just in this context. We conclude by examining a potential pitfall of the Guideline: Unwilling transplant recipients may not comply with immunosuppressive medication, which raises questions for policies based on resource management and rationing.;;Etheredge H, Paget G;;eng;['Africa', 'Developing Countries', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics/methods', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Renal Dialysis/*ethics', 'South Africa', '*Treatment Refusal'];['South Africa', 'developing world', 'distributive justice', 'ethics', 'organ', 'rationing treatment', 'transplantation'];;;10.1111/dewb.12067

794;24935278;Article;2014;BMC medical ethics;;Ethical issues relating to renal transplantation from prediabetic living donor.;;"BACKGROUND: In Mexico, diabetes mellitus is the main cause of end - stage kidney  disease, and some patients may be transplant candidates. Organ supply is limited  because of cultural issues. And, there is a lack of standardized clinical guidelines regarding organ donation. These issues highlight the tension surrounding the fact that living donors are being selected despite being prediabetic. This article presents, examines and discusses using the principles of non-maleficience, autonomy, justice and the constitutionally guaranteed right  to health, the ethical considerations that arise from considering a prediabetic person as a potential kidney donor. DISCUSSION: Diabetes is an absolute contraindication for donating a kidney. However, the transplant protocols most frequently used in Mexico do not consider prediabetes as exclusion criteria. In prediabetic persons there are well known metabolic alterations that may compromise the long - term outcomes of the transplant if such donors are accepted. Even so, many of them are finally included because there are not enough donor candidates. Both, families and hospitals face the need to rapidly accept prediabetic donors before the clinical conditions of the recipient and the evolution of the disease exclude him/her as a transplant candidate; however, when using a kidney potentially damaged by prediabetes, neither the donor's nor the recipient's long term health is usually considered.Considering the ethical implication as well as the clinical and epidemiological evidence, we conclude that prediabetic persons are not suitable candidates for kidney donation. This recommendation should be taken into consideration by Mexican health institutions  who should rewrite their transplant protocols. SUMMARY: We argue that the decision to use a kidney from a living donor known to be pre-diabetic or from those persons with family history of T2DM, obesity, hypertension, or renal failure, should be considered unethical in Mexico if the donor bases the decision to donate on socially acceptable norms rather than informed consent as understood in modern medicine.";;Ferreira-Hermosillo A, Valdez-Martinez E, Bedolla M;;eng;['Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Awareness', 'Female', 'Government Regulation', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent/ethics', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', '*Prediabetic State', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1186/1472-6939-15-45

While brain death has been widely accepted as a  determination of death throughout the world, many of the controversies that surround it have not been settled. Some may be rooted in a misconstruction about  the history of brain death. The concept evolved as a result of the convergence of several parallel developments in the second half of the 20th century including advances in resuscitation and critical care, research into the underlying physiology of consciousness, and growing concerns about technology, medical futility, and the ethics of end of life care. Organ transplantation also developed in parallel, and though it clearly benefited from a new definition of death, it was not a principal driving force in its creation. Since 1968, the concept of brain death has been extensively analyzed, debated, and reworked. Still there remains much misunderstanding and confusion, especially in the general public.

To ensure that advocacy remains fair and consistent for all donors being considered, the donor advocacy team at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center developed  the Independent Donor Ethical Assessment, a tool that may be useful to others in  rendering donor advocacy.

Five-year survival rates after lung transplantation are >50% for children and young adults. But there are not enough lungs to save everyone who could benefit. In 2005, the United Network for Organ Sharing developed a scoring system to prioritize patients for transplantation. That system considered transplant urgency as well as time on the waiting list and the  likelihood that the patient would benefit from the transplant. At the time, there were so few pediatric lung transplants that the data that were used to develop the Lung Allocation Score were inadequate to analyze and prioritize children, so  they were left out of the Lung Allocation Score system. In 2013, the family of a  10-year-old challenged this system, claiming that it was unjust to children.

803;24881893;Article;2014;The Journal of emergency medicine;;Ethical controversies surrounding the management of potential organ donors in the emergency department.;;BACKGROUND: On a daily basis, emergency physicians are confronted by patients with devastating neurological injuries and insults. Some of these patients, despite our best efforts, will not survive. However, from these tragedies, there  may be benefit given to others who are awaiting organ transplantation. Steps taken in the emergency department (ED) can be critical to preserving the option of organ donation in patients whose neurologic insult places them on a potential  path to declaration of brain death. Much of the literature on this subject has focused on the utilitarian value of clinical interventions in the potential organ donor to optimize the likelihood of effective organ procurement. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we present an actual case that reveals additional  ethical perspectives to consider in how emergency physicians manage patients in the ED who can be confidently predicted to progress to death, as attested by neurologic criteria, and become organ donors. The case involves a patient with a  devastating, nonsurvivable intracerebral hemorrhage who rapidly progressed to hemodynamic instability. DISCUSSION: This case reveals how the current organ donor referral and maintenance system raises ethical tensions for emergency physicians and ED personnel.

There are limited data available on outcomes of third HTx after failure of a second graft. We sought to compare outcomes of third HTx in pediatric and young adult patients with outcomes of second HTx in comparable recipients. METHODS: All recipients of a third HTx in whom the primary HTx occurred before 21 years of age were identified in the United Network for Organ Sharing database (1985 to 2011) and matched 1:3 with a control group of second HTx patients by age, era and re-HTx indication. Outcomes including survival, rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) were compared between groups.  RESULTS: There was no difference between third HTx patients (n = 27) and control  second HTx patients (n = 79) with respect to survival (76% vs 80% at 1 year, 62%  vs 58% at 5 years and 53% vs 34% at 10 years, p = 0.75), early (<1 year from HTx) rejection (33.3% vs 44.3%, p = 0.32) or CAV (14.8% vs 30.4%, p = 0.11). Factors associated with non-survival in third HTx patients included mechanical ventilation at listing or HTx, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support at listing or HTx, and elevated serum bilirubin at HTx. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes among  recipients of a third HTx are similar to those with a second HTx in matched patients, with no difference in short- or long-term survival and comparable rates of early rejection and CAV.

Beneficence, non-maleficence, donor autonomy, altruistic donor motivation, coercion-free donation, fully informed consent and avoidance of medical paternalism have been the dominant ethical principles governing this field ever since the first successful living donor kidney transplant in 1954. The increasing reliance on living donors due to  the rapidly growing disparity between the number of patients awaiting transplantation and the availability of deceased donor kidneys has brought with it a variety of new ethical issues of even greater complexity. Issues such as confidentiality of donor and recipient medical information, the appropriateness of the invented medical excuse to avoid donation and the approach to misattributed paternity discovered during work-up for living donor transplantation have made the information to be disclosed prior to obtaining donor's consent much more extensive. In this article, we review the current thinking and guidelines (which have evolved considerably over the past several decades) regarding these ethical issues using five illustrative case vignettes based on donors personally evaluated by us over the past 35 years.;;Venkat KK, Eshelman AK;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', '*Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1016/j.trre.2014.04.001

Summarizing results from our previous qualitative social research in this field, this paper illustrates the ethical significance of such public moralities in two respects: On one hand, it analyzes the implicit bias of the common rhetoric of ""organ scarcity"" which motivates much of the commercialization debate. On the other hand, it explores the blind spots of the paradigm of ""altruistic donation"" which  informs many arguments against commercialization. We conclude that the ethical discourse has to appreciate the social nature of organ donation as a reciprocal interaction between different parties with irreducibly different but equally relevant viewpoints.

METHODS: An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 569 nurses in 79 facilities that performed organ transplantation with living or brain-dead donors who provided approval for this study. The questionnaire, developed according to the Likert method, was composed of 12 items referring to the basic attributes of nursing professionals based on the results of previous studies and  the scientific literature, as well as 27 items referring to the presence or absence and the frequency and severity of concerns regarding ethical situations.

This paper offers ethical criticism of the priority system arguing that the ""reward"" is by necessary also a ""punishment"". Moreover, because  donor-cards have no binding power in Israeli law, the reward/punishment is actually directed at declarations, not actions, and, consequently, violates the freedom of conscience and expression. The reward system is also incompatible with fundamental values of medical ethics and with the very logic of talion, because the law punishes non-signers but not patients who are responsible for the loss of their organs. Lastly, I argue, that because priority on a waiting list is a positional good, it communicates a false message as if donation is an excellence  of the few, and it legitimizes a rational choice to prefer wholesomeness of the cadaver to the risk of low rank in the priority list.";;Barilan YM;;heb;['Altruism', 'Health Care Rationing/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;

821;24781340;Article;2015;Nursing ethics;;Do we treat individuals as patients or as potential donors? A phenomenological study of healthcare professionals' experiences.;;BACKGROUND: Organ donation and transplantation have made it possible to both save life and to improve the quality of life for a large number of patients. In the last years there has been an increasing gap between the number of patients who need organs and organs available for transplantation, and the focus worldwide has been on how to meet the organ shortage. This also rises some ethical challenges.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' experience of ethics related to care and interaction with critically ill patients with severe brain injuries and their families. RESEARCH DESIGN: A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to explore the participants' experiences. Methods for collecting data were a combination of participant observations and in-depth interviews. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT: Two ICUs in a Norwegian university hospital were recruited for data collection. A total of 12 cases were  observed, and 32 of the healthcare professionals involved were interviewed. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Research Ethics. Permission to the study in the ICUs was obtained from the Chief  Physician in the two ICUs respectively. The right of the participants was ensured by written, voluntary, and informed consent. FINDINGS: From the thematic analysis, a structure of the participants' experiences emerged as a process. While the patients' condition was clarified through phases of prognostic ambiguity, gradual clarification and prognostic certainty, interaction with the families was characterized by ambiguity that involved withholding. The prognostic process had a great impact on how the healthcare professionals interacted with the family. The interaction challenged the participants' caring values in various ways and captured an important structure in their experiences of the ethical interaction with the patients' families. These challenges distinguish caring for  families in donation situations from caring for relatives of critically ill patients in general. DISCUSSION: In the discussion we have illuminated how professional ethics may be threatened by more pragmatic and utilitarian arguments contained in regulations and transplant act. CONCLUSION: Ethical questions should be discussed more both in educations of healthcare professionals and in clinical  practice.;;Oroy A, Stromskag KE, Gjengedal E;;eng;['Brain Death', 'Communication', 'Critical Illness/*therapy', 'Empathy', 'Family/psychology', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Intensive Care Units/*ethics', 'Norway', '*Patient Participation', 'Quality of Life', 'Tissue Donors/*classification'];['Critical care nursing', 'ethical challenges', 'healthcare professionals', 'interaction with family', 'organ donation', 'phenomenology'];;;10.1177/0969733014523170

While I offer support for the use of social media mechanisms in the service of the promotion of organ donation public health  initiatives, there are several ethical concerns surrounding informed consent. While Facebook has made a noble effort to aid public health initiatives focused on organ donation, the current application does not promote decisions that are based on individuals' personal values and goals. Without an intervention that promotes an understanding and appreciation of a decision for or against donation, the application does not obtain informed consent. Without first ensuring that a Facebook member has registered with her or his own state donor registry, this social media mechanism may create more confusion than clarity about an individual's organ donor status. If Facebook desires to have a positive impact on the rates of organ donation, it must do so in a manner that obtains proper consent and promotes ethically informed decisions.;;Pena AM;;eng;['*Attitude to Health', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', '*Social Media', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;
823;24769621;Article;2015;Journal of medical ethics;;A narrative review of the empirical evidence on public attitudes on brain death and vital organ transplantation: the need for better data to inform policy.;;Vital organ transplantation is premised on 'the dead donor rule': donors must be  declared dead according to medical and legal criteria prior to donation. However, it is controversial whether individuals diagnosed as 'brain dead' are really dead in accordance with the established biological conception of death-the irreversible cessation of the functioning of the organism as a whole. A basic understanding of brain death is also relevant for giving valid, informed consent  to serve as an organ donor. There is therefore a need for reliable empirical data on public understanding of brain death and vital organ transplantation. We conducted a review of the empirical literature that identified 43 articles with approximately 18,603 study participants. These data demonstrate that participants generally do not understand three key issues: (1) uncontested biological facts about brain death, (2) the legal status of brain death and (3) that organs are procured from brain dead patients while their hearts are still beating and before their removal from ventilators. These data suggest that, despite scholarly claims of widespread public support for organ donation from brain dead patients, the existing data on public attitudes regarding brain death and organ transplantation reflect substantial public confusion. Our review raises questions about the validity of consent for vital organ transplantation and suggests that existing data are of little assistance in developing policy proposals for organ transplantation from brain dead patients.

824;24763442;Article;2014;World journal of surgery;;History and evolution of surgical ethics: John Gregory to the twenty-first century.;;As surgery grew to become a respected medical profession in the eighteenth century, medical ethics emerged as a response to the growing need to protect patients and maintain the public's trust in physicians. The early influences of John Gregory and Thomas Percival were instrumental in the formulation of patient-centered medical ethics. In the late nineteenth century, the modern surgical advances of anesthesia and antisepsis created the need for a discipline  of ethics specific to surgery in order to confront new and evolving ethical issues. One of the founding initiatives of the American College of Surgeons in 1913 was to eliminate unethical practices such as fee-splitting and itinerant surgery. As surgery continued to advance in the era of solid organ transplantation and minimally invasive surgery in the latter half of the twentieth century, surgical innovation and conflict of interest have emerged as important ethical issues moving forward into the twenty-first century. Surgical ethics has evolved into a distinct branch of medical ethics, and the core of surgical ethics is the surgeon-patient relationship and the surgeon's responsibility to advance and protect the well-being of the patient.;;Namm JP, Siegler M, Brander C, Kim TY, Lowe C, Angelos P;;eng;['Ethics, Medical/*history', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Patient-Centered Care/*history', 'Physician-Patient Relations/*ethics', 'Scotland', 'Specialties, Surgical/ethics/*history', 'Surgeons/ethics/*history', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative/ethics', 'United States'];;;;10.1007/s00268-014-2584-1

Observational studies have indicated better long-term patency when using radial arteries. Therefore, radial artery might be preferred especially in younger patients where long time patency is important. During the last 10 years different endoscopic techniques to harvest the radial artery have evolved. Endoscopic radial artery harvest only requires a small incision near the wrist in contrast to open harvest, which requires an incision from the elbow to the wrist. However, it is unknown whether the endoscopic technique results in fewer complications or a graft patency comparable to open harvest. When the radial artery has been harvested, there are two ways to use the radial artery as a graft. One way is sewing it onto the aorta and another is sewing it onto the mammary artery. It is unknown which technique is the superior  revascularisation technique. METHODS/DESIGN: The NEO Trial is a randomised clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design. We plan to randomise 300 participants into four intervention groups: (1) mammario-radial endoscopic group; (2) aorto-radial endoscopic group; (3) mammario-radial open surgery group; and (4) aorto-radial open surgery group.The hand function will be assessed by a questionnaire, a clinical examination, the change in cutaneous sensibility, and the measurement of both sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity at 3 months postoperatively. All the postoperative complications will be registered, and we will evaluate muscular function, scar appearance, vascular supply to the hand, and the graft patency including the patency of the central radial artery anastomosis. A patency evaluation by multi-slice computer tomography will be done at one year postoperatively.We expect the nerve conduction studies and the standardised neurological examinations to be able to discriminate differences in  hand function comparing endoscopic to open harvest of the radial artery. The trial also aims to show if there is any patency difference between mammario-radial compared to aorto-radial revascularisation techniques but this objective is exploratory.

An expanded view  of risks and benefits.;;Recent Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policies relating to living  kidney donation (LKD)warrant renewed attention to the ethics of transplantation from living donors. These policies focus on risks related to potential donor evaluation, informed consent and follow-up. The ethical basis of living donation  is a favorable risk/benefit ratio for the donor, but regulations and research have given less attention to the benefits of donation. Relatedly, the transplant  field has also failed to consider potential harms from denying patients the opportunity to donate. These harms may be substantial in the setting of directed  kidney donation to a spouse/partner, sibling or child.We argue that complete assessment of donor risks and benefits demands consideration of not only the risks and benefits of donation, but also those of refusing a donor. In contrast to the ever-expanding literature on risks of donation, there are no data describing outcomes for individuals who were turned down as kidney donors. We consider factors contributing to this omission in the transplant literature, argue that current regulations may perpetuate a narrow understanding of relevant  risks and benefits in LKD, and identify areas for improvement in research and clinical practice.;;Allen MB, Abt PL, Reese PP;;eng;['Graft Survival/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/*therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*ethics/psychology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1111/ajt.12599

Knowledge about the attitudes and beliefs among the general public about living kidney donation is limited. We aimed to describe public perspectives on living kidney donation. METHODS: Participants were recruited from three states in Australia to participate in 12 focus groups (n=113). Transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: We identified six themes: expected benefits (saving and improving life,  societal gain, donor satisfaction, reassurance and control), consciousness of donor risks (compromised health, lifestyle limitations, financial consequences, relationship tensions, devastation), social precariousness (fear of the unknown,  exploitative connotation, recipient deservingness, protecting conscience, potential regret), upholding fairness (equal access to transplantation, reciprocity, prevent prejudice, donor safety net), decisional autonomy (body ownership, right to know, valid relationships), and assumed duty of care (facilitate informed decision-making, safeguard against coercion, ensure psychological safety, justifiable risk, objectivity, warranted disclosure). CONCLUSION: The expected benefits for recipients bolster public support for living kidney donor transplantation; however, ethical dilemmas and concerns for the donor instilled ambivalence about living donation. Protecting equity and autonomy, and an implicit trust in health professionals to protect donors and recipients mitigated some of these uncertainties.

This study aims to describe the range of attitudes and opinions of transplant physicians on financial reimbursement, compensation, and incentives in living kidney donation.  STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 110 transplant nephrologists and surgeons from 12 countries across 43 transplantation units in Europe, Australasia, and North America. METHODOLOGY: Face-to-face semistructured  interviews were conducted. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Transcripts were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 7 major themes. Prioritizing the removal of disincentives for living kidney donors was largely deemed acceptable. By contrast, provision of financial incentives raised concerns about undermining benevolence, compromising human dignity and value, and traversing market forces.  Some contended that financial incentives potentially were legitimate if regulated, arguing that this would maximize utility in transplantation, but most  also acknowledged the difficulty and that operational feasibility of a regulated  system of financial incentivization may be limited. LIMITATIONS: Participants were English speaking and from Western high-income countries; therefore, the transferability of our findings may be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation specialists believed that minimizing disincentives would support equity and justice in living kidney donation. Direct financial incentivization for living kidney donors, even in the context of a regulated market, was regarded by most as unjustified because of the potential moral consequences and uncertain feasibility. Removing financial disincentives and safeguarding the intrinsic volunteerism, value, and meaning of donation were viewed to uphold integrity in living kidney donation.";;Tong A, Chapman JR, Wong G, Craig JC;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Altruism', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Australasia', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation/economics/ethics/psychology', '*Living Donors/ethics/psychology/supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Marketing of Health Services/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Middle Aged', '*Nephrology', 'North America', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reimbursement, Incentive/*organization & administration', 'Surgeons/ethics/*psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];['Kidney transplantation', 'altruism', 'donor incentives', 'donor reimbursement', 'health policy', 'interviews', 'kidney donation', 'living donor', 'organ shortage', 'qualitative research', 'renal transplant'];;;10.1053/j.ajkd.2014.02.019

836;24646775;Article;2014;Transplantation;;Relationships between Islamic religiosity and attitude toward deceased organ donation among American Muslims: a pilot study.;;BACKGROUND: Religion-rooted beliefs and values are often cited as barriers to organ donation among Muslims. Yet how Islamic religiosity relates to organ donation attitude among Muslims is less studied. METHODS: Using a community based participatory research approach, we recruited adults from mosque communities to self-administer a questionnaire assessing levels of Islamic religiosity, attitude toward deceased organ donation, and sociodemographic descriptors. RESULTS: Of the 97 respondents, there were nearly equal numbers of men and women. Over a third were Arab American (n=36), and nearly a quarter were either South Asian (n=23) or African American (n=25). Respondents viewing difficulties in life as punishment from God had a decreased odds of believing deceased organ donation to be justified (OR 0.85, P<0.05). Other measures of Islamic religiosity, such as intrinsic religiosity, positive religious coping and one related to following Islamic ethical guidelines, were not associated with organ donation attitude. Arab Muslims were more likely to believe deceased organ donation to be justified  than South Asian or African Americans (OR 7.06, P<0.05). Sociodemographic descriptors including age, sex, and country of origin, as well as self-reported health and trust of the American health-care system, were not significantly associated with attitude toward deceased organ donation. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of intrinsic religiosity or adherence to Islamic ethics do not appear to associate with negative attitudes toward deceased organ donation. Negative religious coping appears, however, to be related to lower rates of believing deceased organ donation to be justified. Future studies with larger samples that  incorporate additional measures of religiosity can further clarify relationships  between religiosity and organ donation attitude among Muslim communities.;;Padela AI, Zaganjor H;;eng;['Adult', 'African Americans/psychology', 'Aged', 'Arabs/psychology', 'Asian Americans/psychology', 'Attitude to Death/*ethnology', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Ethnic Groups/*psychology', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/*ethnology', 'Humans', 'Islam/*psychology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minority Groups/*psychology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Organ Transplantation/*psychology', 'Perception', 'Pilot Projects', '*Religion and Medicine', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology', 'United States/epidemiology'];;;;10.1097/01.TP.0000441874.43007.81

We briefly describe the major milestones of this multidisciplinary clinical science, the challenges that it still faces, and we consider the crucial contribution that its example could set for other medical fields. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted and a selection of images was made to complete a brief history of organ transplantation, with a particular focus on liver transplantation. RESULTS: The largest problem affecting organ transplantation today is the shortage of organs.  Attention should be given to preserving the peculiar high ethical value that characterizes the very nature of organ transplantation.

838;24634062;Article;2014;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;The donor organ as an 'object a': a Lacanian perspective on organ donation and transplantation medicine.;;Bioethical discourse on organ donation covers a wide range of topics, from informed consent procedures and scarcity issues up to 'transplant tourism' and 'organ trade'. This paper presents a 'depth ethics' approach, notably focussing on the tensions, conflicts and ambiguities concerning the status of the human body (as something which constitutes a whole, while at the same time being a set  of replaceable elements or parts). These will be addressed from a psychoanalytical (Lacanian) angle. First, I will outline Lacan's view on embodiment as such. Subsequently, I will argue that, for organ recipients, the donor organ becomes what Lacan refers to as an object a, the 'partial object' of  desire, the elusive thing we are deprived of, apparently beyond our grasp. Within the recipient's body an empty space emerges, a kind of 'vacuole', once occupied by a faltering organ (now removed). This space can only be filled by a 'gift' from the other, by an object a. Once implanted, however, this implant becomes an  'extimate' object: something both 'external' and 'intimate', both 'embedded' and  'foreign', and which is bound to remain an object of concern for quite some time, if not for life. A Lacanian analysis allows us, first of all, to address the question what organ transplantation has in common with other bodily practices involving bodily parts procured from others, such as cannibalism. But it also reveals the basic difference between the two, as well as the distance between the 'fragmented body' of Frankenstein's 'monster'--as an aggregate of replaceable parts--and the multiple organ recipients (the 'puzzle people') of today.;;Zwart H;;eng;['Human Body', 'Humans', 'Love', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Philosophy, Medical', 'Psychoanalytic Theory', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];;;;10.1007/s11019-014-9553-1

This study surveyed non-physician providers from 20 transplant  centers about their educational and informed consent practices of IRD kidneys. METHODS: An anonymous, web-based survey about the content and timing of education and informed consent for potential recipients of IRD kidneys, providers' knowledge of IRD kidneys, and provider and center characteristics was completed by most (67%; 90 of 135) of those invited to participate; 87 responses were included in analysis. RESULTS: Most (80%) reported understanding the concept of IRD kidneys. However, few reported sufficient knowledge of the Organ Procurement  and Transplantation Network definition of IRDs, risk factors, screening tests, window periods, and infection transmission rates. Most (56%) felt uncomfortable with obtaining specific informed consent for IRD kidneys. Most respondents received informal education about IRD kidneys (78%), and recognized the need for  (98%) and were interested in receiving (99%) further education on this topic.

The results of a nominal group study.;;"Rates of transplantation from deceased donors remain low, despite high rates of expressed support. We aimed to better understand this mismatch through determining community attitudes regarding willingness to register as organ donors. Participants were recruited from the general public in four Australian states. Using nominal group techniques, participants ranked factors they believed were important when deciding to register as a deceased donor. Thirteen nominal groups with 114 participants were conducted. 24 factors were ranked by three or more groups. The top ten factors were as follows: saving lives, own decision to donate, family opinions, benefit to recipients, process of organ donation, positive media, positive closure, clarity of consent and body dignity. Other factors included: the consent system, religious and cultural beliefs and incentives for donation. Participant age was a potential modifier of responses. Willingness to register as an organ donor is highly influenced by the altruistic  motive of saving lives and improving lives for others; this should be harnessed in communication campaigns. Further research on ethical incentives for organ donation and continued efforts to promote support from religious groups may be useful. Many believe the sole right to consent to donation is theirs and not their families; consent policies reflecting this should be explored.";;Irving MJ, Jan S, Tong A, Wong G, Craig JC, Chadban S, Rose J, Cass A, Allen RD, Howard K;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Altruism', 'Australia', 'Culture', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult'];['altruism', 'consent', 'donor registries', 'organ donation', 'qualitative'];;;10.1111/tri.12307

The authors of this article present a framework for ethical decision-making that has been successfully developed in the context of research with bereaved families. The discussion focuses on application and evaluation of the framework during research with family members who were approached about the donation of a deceased relative's organs and/or tissues for  transplantation. Practical strategies of relevance to the processes of participant recruitment, the interview encounter and follow-up care in the post-interview period are identified and discussed.

842;24614190;Article;2014;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Ethical dilemmas in psychiatric evaluations in patients with fulminant liver failure.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is one of the more dramatic and challenging syndromes in clinical medicine. Time constraints and the scarcity of organs complicate the evaluation process in the case of patients presenting with FHF, raising ethical questions related to fairness and justice. The challenges are compounded by an absence of standardized guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: Acetaminophen overdose, often occurring in patients with histories of psychiatric illness and substance dependence, has emerged as the most common cause of FHF. The weak correlations between psychosocial factors and nonadherence, as per some studies, suggest that adherence may be influenced by systematic factors. Most research suggests that applying rigid ethical parameters in these patients, rather than allowing for case-dependent flexibility, can be problematic. SUMMARY: The decision to transplant in patients with FHF has to be made in a very narrow window of time. The time-constrained process is fraught with uncertainties and limitations, given the absence of patient interview, fluctuating medical eligibility, and limited data. Although standardized scales exist, their benefit in such settings appears limited. Predicting compliance with posttransplant medical regimens is difficult to assess and raises the question of prospective studies to monitor compliance.;;Appel J, Vaidya S;;eng;['Acetaminophen/*toxicity', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*toxicity', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', '*Intelligence Tests', 'Liver Failure, Acute/chemically induced/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Mental Disorders/complications', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics', 'Substance-Related Disorders/complications', 'Suicide, Attempted'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000060

Patient 1-year survival better than 95% has been achieved using this kind of transplantation. According to the postoperative complication rate (5% mortality), recipients appear to have a survival benefit not earlier than 2 years after transplantation. This study evaluates the long-term benefit of simultaneous pancreas-kidney recipients with functioning grafts after 1 year. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 176 patients after first transplantation with functioning grafts 1 year after simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation was performed. RESULTS: During the follow-up period starting 1 year after successful transplantation, 7 patients died due to various causes, 13  pancreas grafts (7.4%) and 13 kidney transplants (7.4%) lost their function during the 10-year follow-up period. Chronic graft failure was the most common reason for transplant loss.

Mortality raises the issue of risk versus benefit for face transplantation, a procedure intended to improve quality of life, rather than saving life. Thus, one of the most innovative surgical procedures has opened the debate on the ethical, legal, and philosophical aspects of face transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Morbidity in face transplant recipients includes infections and metabolic consequences. No graft loss caused by technical failure, hyperacute, or chronic graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease has  been reported. One case of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, 3.45% and one case of lymphoma in an HIV-positive recipient were reported. Psychological issues in candidates can include chronic pain, mood disorders, preexisting psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse.  SUMMARY: Early publications on ethical aspects of face transplantation focused mainly on informed consent. Many other ethical issues have been identified, including lack of coercion, donor family consent and confidentiality, respect for the integrity of the donor's body, and financial promotion of the recipient and transplant team, as well as the cost to society for such a highly technical procedure, requiring lifelong immunosuppression.;;Coffman KL, Siemionow MZ;;eng;['Bioethics', 'Facial Transplantation/*ethics', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Psychophysiology/*ethics', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000058
846;24553498;Article;2014;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Treating the donor.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current pressures of organ supply and demand require maximization of potential for organ donation. The donor population is older and has more significant comorbidity than in the past.Optimal management of the donor after brain death (DBD) is essential to ensure that the greatest number of organs can be transplanted per donor. Defining evidence-based drugs and techniques to assist this has never been more important. RECENT FINDINGS: Care of patients with catastrophic brain injury incorporating supportive therapy targeted at specific goals and delivered by experienced specialists provides the best donation outcomes. Such pathways represent best practice critical care applied to this population. In this context, the value of some previously recommended therapies appears questionable and warrants reassessment. Prolonged (>24 h) incorporeal organ conditioning may have significant benefits.Extracorporeal support in the resuscitation arena is emerging and, in patients who fail to respond, may yield a new source of donors. SUMMARY: Early identification of potential DBD, best practice critical care, and achieving defined treatment goals are associated with more transplantable organs.

848;24547770;Article;2015;Bioethics;;Altruism and reward: motivational compatibility in deceased organ donation.;;Acts of helping others are often based on mixed motivations. Based on this claim, it has been argued that the use of a financial reward to incentivize organ donation is compatible with promoting altruism in organ donation. In its report Human Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics uses this argument to justify its suggestion to pilot a funeral payment scheme to incentivize people to register for deceased organ donation in the UK. In this article, I cast a sceptical eye on the above Nuffield report's argument that its proposed funeral payment scheme would prompt deceased organ donations that remain altruistic (as defined by and valued the report). Specifically, I illustrate how this scheme may prompt various forms of mixed motivations which would not satisfy the report's definition of altruism. Insofar as the scheme produces an expectation of the reward, it stands diametrical to promoting an 'altruistic perspective'. My minimal goal in this article is to argue that altruism is not motivationally compatible with reward as an incentive for donation. My broader goal is to argue that if a financial reward is used to incentivize organ donation, then we should recognize that the donation system is  no longer aiming to promote altruism. Rewarded donation would not be altruistic but it may be ethical given a persistent organ shortage situation.;;Voo TC;;eng;['*Altruism', '*Commerce', 'Death', 'Ethics Committees', 'Humans', '*Motivation', '*Reward', '*Social Responsibility', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/*ethics', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];['Titmuss', 'altruism', 'motivation', 'organ donation', 'payment', 'reward', 'transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12078

RECENT FINDINGS: There are a number of blog sites that have reported that Jehovah's Witnesses have changed their position on transfusion, but communications with them have revealed these reports to be untrue. Most articles about the treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses focus on respect for personal autonomy and the right to refuse treatment. Although this is imperative, especially in the USA, it is important not only to respect this right, but also to ensure that the patient understands all of his or her options, is making these decisions free of coercion, is optimally prepared for surgery and that the anesthesia provider is fully prepared. The anesthesiologist's rights should be respected as well.

854;24478386;Article;2014;Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine;;Bioethics of organ transplantation.;;As the ability to transplant organs and tissues has grown, the demand for these procedures has increased as well--to the point at which it far exceeds the available supply creating the core ethical challenge for transplantation--rationing. The gap between supply and demand, although large, is worse than it appears to be. There are two key steps to gaining access to a transplant. First, one must gain access to a transplant center. Then, those waiting need to be selected for a transplant. Many potential recipients do not get admitted to a program. They are deemed too old, not of the right nationality, not appropriate for transplant as a result of severe mental impairment, criminal  history, drug abuse, or simply because they do not have access to a competent primary care physician who can refer them to a transplant program. There are also financial obstacles to access to transplant waiting lists in the United States and other nations. In many poor nations, those needing transplants simply die because there is no capacity or a very limited capacity to perform transplants. Although the demand for organs now exceeds the supply, resulting in rationing, the size of waiting lists would quickly expand were there to suddenly be an equally large expansion in the number of organs available for transplantation. Still, even with the reality of unavoidable rationing, saving more lives by increasing organ supply is a moral good. Current public policies for obtaining organs from cadavers are not adequate in that they do not produce the number of organs that public polls of persons in the United States indicate people are willing to donate.;;Caplan A;;eng;['Attitude to Health', 'Health Care Rationing/ethics', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Motivation', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Public Opinion', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/organization & administration'];;;;10.1101/cshperspect.a015685

The serum level of sFGL2 and the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg in the peripheral blood were measured in renal allograft recipients with AR or stable renal function (n = 30 per group). The human TEC was stimulated with sFGL2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or phosphate buffered saline and investigated for apoptosis in vitro. Apoptosis-associated genes expression in TEC was further assessed. Approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Fudan University. Our results showed that the serum level of sFGL2, correlated with Treg in the peripheral blood, was significantly increased in the AR patients. In vitro, sFGL2 remarkably induced TEC apoptosis, with a significant up-regulation of proapoptotic genes, including CASP-3, CASP-8, CASP-9, CASP-10, TRADD, TNFSF10, FADD, FAS, FASLG, BAK1, BAD, BAX, and NF-KB1. However, no significant changes were observed in the expression of antiapoptotic genes, including CARD-18, NAIP,  BCL2, IKBKB, and TBK1. Therefore, sFGL2, an effector of Treg, induces TEC apoptosis. Our study suggests that sFGL2 is a potential mediator in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection and provides novel insights into the role of  Treg in AR.;;Zhao Z, Yang C, Wang L, Li L, Zhao T, Hu L, Rong R, Xu M, Zhu T;;eng;['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Kidney Tubules/*cytology/drug effects', 'Male', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects'];['Soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2', 'apoptosis', 'regulatory T cells', 'renal transplantation', 'tubular epithelial cells'];;;10.1177/1535370213514921

While the allocation of allografts to wait-listed patients is done in a transparent manner, with its rules open to public debate and prone to continuous improvement, the practice of wait-listing is not centrally regulated, and its rules are often less scrutinized. Denial of kidney transplant wait-listing to obese individuals has been a common practice by most transplant centers. On the face of it, this practice is justified by commonly accepted ethical standards, yet there is now mounting evidence that these justifications do not withstand closer scrutiny. A candid and open debate in the Nephrology and Transplant community is needed to examine the true motivations that underlie the practice of denying wait-listing to obese individuals, and to find a solution that is truly in the best interest of our patients.;;Kovesdy CP, Molnar MZ;;eng;['Cost Savings', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/prevention & control', 'Quality Indicators, Health Care', 'Refusal to Treat/*ethics', 'Resource Allocation/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', '*Waiting Lists', 'Weight Loss'];;;;10.1111/sdi.12157
861;24398855;Article;2014;Transplantation;;Human trafficking for organ removal in India: a victim-centered, evidence-based report.;;BACKGROUND: Enhancements in the national transplant law to prohibit commercial transplants in India have curbed the trade. Yet, the human rights abuse of human  trafficking for organ removal (HTOR) continues in various transplant centers throughout India. METHODS: Beginning in September 2010 until May 2012, in-depth interviews were conducted with 103 victims of HTOR in India in which victims described their experiences of a commercial kidney removal in compelling detail.  Victims were located in Tamil Nadu, and reference is made to the broader study that included 50 additional victims in small towns and villages in West Bengal and Karnataka. RESULTS: Fourteen cases (14%) in Tamil Nadu and an additional 20 cases (40%) from West Bengal and Karnataka occurred between 2009 to May 2012. The cases in Tamil Nadu ranged in age from 19 to 55 years, with an average age of 33  years in Erode and 36 years in Chennai. Fifty-seven percent of the victims in Erode are female, and 87% of the victims in Chennai are female. Twelve percent of the individuals were widowed or abandoned, 79% were married, and 91% were parents with an average of two kids. Of those interviewed, 28% had no formal education, 19% had some primary schooling, 22% had some secondary schooling, and no individuals reported schooling above high school. All victims interviewed lived in abject poverty with monthly income levels well below the national average. The majority of victims reported long lasting health, economic, social, and psychological consequences. No matter the reason expressed for an organ sale, all victims reported that they would not have agreed to the organ removal if their economic circumstances were not so dire. One hundred percent of the victims interviewed expressed that they need assistance to cope with these consequences.  CONCLUSIONS: Human trafficking for an organ removal continues in private transplant centers throughout India, service to foreign patients is ongoing, and  victims' consequences are long lasting. A rights-based response to HTOR that invokes a universal commitment to prevent, protect, and suppress its continued practice is recommended. The United Nations Trafficking Protocol is the key international instrument to address trafficking of persons, including for organ removal. India has signed the UN Trafficking Protocol and should ratify it to better address this form of human trafficking.;;Budiani-Saberi DA, Raja KR, Findley KC, Kerketta P, Anand V;;eng;['Adult', 'Crime', 'Female', 'Human Rights', 'Human Trafficking/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'India', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Living Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrectomy/ethics', 'Poverty', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/*ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'United Nations', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1097/01.TP.0000438624.83472.55
862;24387804;Article;2014;Journal of evaluation in clinical practice;;Singularity and medicine: is there a place for heteronomy in medical ethics?;;RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: In medicine and in clinical practice, autonomy is opposed to heteronomy or paternalism. While autonomy comes down to free choice, independence or self-fulfillment, heteronomy or paternalism are associated with restraints from outside, lack of free choice or dependence. Despite several mediating concepts such as relational autonomy, this opposition stands firm in medical discourse. METHODS AND RESULTS: Reflecting upon his own heart transplantation but also falling back upon the whole of his oeuvre, we want to analyze what the impact of Nancy's thought can be on the concept of autonomy in medicine. As in Nancy's theory, autonomy and heteronomy are intertwined, how then to understand the autonomous individual in a clinical context? Nancy developed in his book Corpus, the untranslatable French word 'expeausition' to express the exposure of surfaces to one another - playing on the term 'exposition': 'peau', in French, means skin. Skin is literally exposed to contact with another skin or  surface. Such exposure and such contact is 'world' he argues, in the same way that a product exchange between two people is. Heteronomy therefore is constitutive for autonomy, not a restraint of it. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzed from the  work of French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, there is no such thing as autonomy because every 'self' or 'I' is always already intruded by something from outside. There is no autonomy without heteronomy, he argues and he therefore prefers to speak of an individual as being exposed to the outer world.;;Devisch I, Vanheule S;;eng;['Anecdotes as Topic', 'Clinical Medicine/methods/trends', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Heart Transplantation/ethics/methods', 'Humans', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Paternalism', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Physician-Patient Relations', '*Professional Autonomy'];['heteronomy', 'patient autonomy', 'patient care', 'singularity', 'technology'];;;10.1111/jep.12110

METHODS: A  decision analytic model with a combination of a decision tree and Markov process  was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Barostim. The clinical effectiveness of Barostim was based on the results of the randomized, placebo-controlled Rheos trial and the follow-up substudy of the DEBuT-HT trial.  The cost-effectiveness was modelled from a German societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. Patients with high SBP levels have an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease. RESULTS: In a simulated cohort of 50-year-old patients at high risk of end-organ  damage, Barostim therapy generated 1.66 additional life-years and 2.17 additional quality-adjusted life years with an incremental cost of &OV0556;16 891 when compared with continuation of medical management. Barostim was estimated to be cost-effective compared with optimal medical treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &OV0556;7 797/QALY. In the model, Barostim reduced over a lifetime the rates of myocardial infarction by 19%, stroke by 35%, heart failure by 12% and end-stage renal disease by 23%. The cost-effectiveness of Barostim can be greater in younger patients with resistant hypertension and in patients with significant risk factors for end-organ damage.

SOURCES OF INFORMATION: The literature search was conducted using Pubmed and Google Scholar. FINDINGS: The use of generic immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) in transplantation is a controversial topic. There is a consensus among transplant societies that clinical data is lacking and that caution should be exercised. The reluctance to use generic ISDs in organ transplantation is partly  related to the fact that most are ""critical dose drugs"", and that either low dosing or overdosing could have serious adverse consequences for both patients and society (i.e., the loss of scarce organs). In this paper, we examine the various ethical issues involved such as distributive justice, physician duties, risks versus benefits, conflict of interest, informed consent, and logistical and economic issues. LIMITATIONS: Our analysis was limited by the paucity of clinical data on generic ISDs and the absence of health economics studies to quantify the  benefits of prescribing generic ISDs. IMPLICATIONS: Our study led us to conclude  that it would be ethical to prescribe generic ISDs provided certain conditions were met. These include regulatory safeguards to minimize the risks of substitution; education of patients; and further clinical and health economics studies to better inform clinicians, patients and society of the risks and costs  related to drug substitution.";;Allard J, Fortin MC;;eng;;['Ethics', 'Generic drugs', 'Immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs)', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1186/s40697-014-0023-8

MOT offers substantial benefits to certain recipients, including avoiding serial surgeries. However, MOT candidates in the United States commonly receive priority for their nonprimary organ over many individuals who need that organ, which may undermine equity. The absence of standard criteria for MOT eligibility also enables large and unfair regional variation in MOT, such as  simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. Unfortunately, MOT may also undermine  utility (optimal patient and graft survival) in circumstances where providing multiple organs to one person fails to achieve the greater collective benefit attained by providing transplants to multiple people. Policy reforms should include the adoption of minimal clinical criteria for MOT candidacy with the attendant goal of decreasing regional variation in MOT. In the future, these minimal criteria can be revised to accommodate new research about which patients  derive the most benefit from MOT. Incentives to perform MOT should also be reduced, such as by including MOT outcomes in center-specific reports. These reforms run the risk that the transplant community could be perceived as abandoning MOT candidates, but offer an opportunity to align transplant practice  and ethical principles.;;Reese PP, Veatch RM, Abt PL, Amaral S;;eng;['Adult', 'Child', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Pancreas Transplantation', '*Patient Selection/ethics', 'Quality of Life', '*Resource Allocation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Waiting Lists'];['Allocation', 'ethics', 'multi-organ transplantation'];;;10.1111/ajt.12557
866;24336398;Article;2014;Journal of medical ethics;;Why does it matter how we regulate the use of human body parts?;;Human tissue and body parts have been used in one way or another for millennia. They have been preserved and displayed, both in museums and public shows. Real human hair is used for wigs, while some artists even use human tissue in their works. Blood, bone marrow, whole organs and a host of other structures and human  substances are all transplanted into living persons to treat illness. New life can be created from gametes through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), while the creation of cell lines keeps tissue alive indefinitely. These uses create significant challenges for the legal system in the UK. The major challenge for the law is to balance the competing demands of those groups who have vested interests in human tissue-researchers, medical practitioners, patients, families, the community and the police, among many others. It must provide sufficient control to users of tissue, but also take account of the fact that our bodies hold psychological importance for us while we live and, after we die, for those we leave behind. To some degree the law has been successful, but we still lack a  comprehensive, coherent approach to the regulation of human tissue. Partially as  a reaction to this lack of a comprehensive approach, some commentators have turned to applying the concept of property to human tissue means to achieve regulatory outcomes they support.;;Goold I;;eng;['Biological Specimen Banks/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Biomedical Research', 'Commodification', 'Education, Medical', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Family/psychology', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Fetal Blood', '*Government Regulation', 'Human Body', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Research Personnel', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics &  numerical data'];['Bills, Laws and Cases', 'Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues', 'History of Health Ethics/Bioethics', 'Law', 'Legal Aspects'];;;10.1136/medethics-2012-100941
867;24113514;Article;2014;Transplantation;;Functional status and survival after kidney transplantation.;;"BACKGROUND: Older patients constitute a growing proportion of U.S. kidney transplant recipients and often have a high burden of comorbidities. A summary measure of health such as functional status might enable transplant professionals to better evaluate and counsel these patients about their prognosis after transplant. METHODS: We linked United Network for Organ Sharing registry data about posttransplantation survival with pretransplantation functional status data (physical function [PF] scale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36) among  individuals undergoing kidney transplant from June 1, 2000 to May 31, 2006. We examined the relationship between survival and functional status with multivariable Cox regression, adjusted for age. Using logistic regression models  for 3-year survival, we also estimated the reduction in deaths in the hypothetical scenario that recipients with poor functional status in this cohort  experienced modest improvements in function. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 10,875 kidney transplant recipients with a mean age of 50 years; 14% were >/=65. Differences in 3-year mortality between highest and lowest PF groups ranged from  3% among recipients <35 years to 14% among recipients >/=65 years. In multivariable Cox regression, worse PF was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.66 for lowest vs. highest PF quartiles; P<0.001). Interactions between PF and age were nonsignificant. We estimated that 11% fewer deaths would  occur if kidney transplant recipients with the lowest functional status experienced modest improvements in function. CONCLUSIONS: Across a wide age range, functional status was an independent predictor of posttransplantation survival.

869;23760730;Article;2014;Journal of medical ethics;;The dead donor rule: effect on the virtuous practice of medicine.;;OBJECTIVE: The President's Council on Bioethics in 2008 reaffirmed the necessity  of the dead donor rule and the legitimacy of the current criteria for diagnosing  both neurological and cardiac death. In spite of this report,many have continued  to express concerns about the ethics of donation after circulatory death, the validity of determining death using neurological criteria and the necessity for maintaining the dead donor rule for organ donation. I analysed the dead donor rule for its effect on the virtuous practice of medicine by physicians caring for potential organ donors. RESULTS: The dead donor rule consistently impedes physicians in fulfilling their primary duty to act for the good of their prospective donor patients. This compromises the virtue of fidelity. It also weakens many other virtues necessary for physicians to provide excellent end-of-life care. CONCLUSIONS: The dead donor rule, while ethically powerful in theory, loses its force during translation to the bedside. This is so because the rule mandates simultaneous life and death within the same body for organ donation, a biological status that is inherently contradictory. The rule should be rejected as an ethical norm governing vital organ transplantation at the end of life. Its elimination will strengthen the doctor-patient relationship and foster trustworthiness in organ procurement.;;Chaten FC;;eng;['*Bioethical Issues', 'Brain Death/*diagnosis', 'Death', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', '*Life Support Care', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1136/medethics-2013-101333

A list of 75 potential screening items was derived from a systematic literature review and sorted and rated for their importance and commonness by multidisciplinary affiliated health care professionals from across  Europe. Results were discussed and fine-tuned during a consensus meeting. RESULTS: The analyses resulted in a 6-cluster solution. The following clusters on psychosocial screening items were identified, listed from most to least important: (1) personal resources, (2) motivation and decision making, (3) psychopathology, (4) social resources, (5) ethical and legal factors, and (6) information and risk processing.

This necessitates an exploration into the patients' views about life and how it should be lived, how the patients constructed their identity or life story, and their attitudes towards sickness and suffering. When an individual appoints a surrogate, such as a healthcare power of attorney, a common presumption is that this designation evinces merit. This obscures the possibility of multiple other considerations that influence individual choice. This article presents a clinical case in which the claim to know someone best created a controversy that brought treatment decisions to a standstill. Further, it illuminates how the question, ""Given the current medical  condition, what would this person want?"" risks presuming that a singular, unambiguous preference exists and that one person can provide the answer. Clinical ethicists can play a vital role in situations when there is a dispute among a designated surrogate and family members over a patient's preference. By embracing the complexity of the desire to synthesize seemingly irreconcilable perspectives about identity, uncovering the reasons that underlie disagreement, and guiding inquiry in such a way that allows stakeholders to move beyond the conflict, clinical ethicists can facilitate decision making that honors the patient and may mitigate moral distress.";;Eves MM, Esplin BS;;eng;['Adult', 'Advance Directives/ethics', 'Choice Behavior/ethics', 'Clinical Decision-Making/ethics', '*Conflict of Interest', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'Dissent and Disputes', 'Ethicists', '*Ethics Consultation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Motivation', 'Negotiating', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Proxy', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/therapy', '*Spouses/psychology', 'Terminal Care/*ethics', 'Withholding Treatment/*ethics'];;;;

No previous study has compared the safety and the efficacy of Osigraft and the ""gold standard"" treatment for recalcitrant long-bones non-union, autologous bone graft (ABG). This study aims to compare the effectiveness of Osigraft and ABG in the treatment of post-traumatic, persistent long bone non-unions. In particular, the present study will focus exclusively on complex persistent non-unions, excluding simpler cases, in which it is likely that a simple revision of the osteosynthesis will be sufficient to promote union, and extremely severe cases in which there is an indication for amputation and prosthesis. The study addresses the following research question: 1. Is the effectiveness of eptotermin alfa comparable to that of ABG in the treatment of complex long bone non-unions? 2. Are there significant differences in the prevalence of adverse events between patients treated with eptotermin alfa and those treated with ABG? The study is an observational, retrospective study, located in one Experimental Recruiting Center (Ospedale Universitario G. PINI - Milano). The study was conducted with ethics approval and according with the existing Italian law. Demographic and clinical data were collected from patients  Clinical Medical Records and other existing documentation, through a web based eCRF. The treatment (surgery with Osigraft or ABG) effectiveness was evaluated comparing the number of success cases (primary endpoint) and the length for clinical and radiological healing (secondary end-points). The treatment safety was evaluating comparing the prevalence of Adverse Events. Osigraft was demonstrated to be statistically equivalent to ABG with respect to the primary and secondary end point of surgical success. The treatment success was statistically comparable across all the anatomical regions considered, both in patients treated with Osigraft and in patients treated with ABG. The use of Osigraft when compared to autograft was associated with statistically lower intraoperative blood loss and shorter operative times. In addition patients treated with Osigraft developed statistically less peri-operative and late onset  adverse events, compared to ABG. The difference was substantially due to the occurrence of pain at donor site in patients treated with ABG.";;Calori GM, Colombo M, Bucci M, Mazza EL, Fadigati P, Mazzola S;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Fracture Fixation, Internal/methods', 'Fracture Healing', 'Fractures, Bone/epidemiology/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Fractures, Ununited/epidemiology/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reoperation/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome'];['BMP-7', 'OP-1', 'Osigraft', 'autograft', 'effectiveness', 'long bones', 'safety'];;;10.1016/S0020-1383(15)30056-5

The use of human-animal  chimeric embryos, however, raises several ethical and moral concerns. The most fundamental one is that human-animal chimeric embryos possess the potential to develop into organisms containing human-derived tissue, which may lead to infringing upon the identity of the human species, and thus impairing human dignity. The Japanese Expert Panel on Bioethics in the Cabinet Office carefully considered the scientific significance and ethical acceptability of the issue and released its ""Opinions regarding the handling of research using human-animal chimeric embryos"". The Panel proposed a framework of case-by-case review, and suggested that the following points must be carefully reviewed from the perspective of ethical acceptability: (a) Types of animal embryos and types of animals receiving embryo transfers, particularly in dealing with non-human primates; (b) Types of human cells and organs intended for production, particularly in dealing with human nerve or germ cells; and (c) Extent of the period required for post-transfer studies.

It discusses the situation in which the physician acts as a counselor for the patient in the way of a sort of ""reverse"" informed consent, in which the patient asks advice regarding a complex personal decision, and includes a peculiar application of the four principles (beneficence, non-maleficence, justice and autonomy) to the donor and recipient parties.";;Piccoli GB, Sacchetti L, Verze L, Cavallo F;;eng;['Humans', '*Kidney', '*Nephrologists', 'Organ Trafficking/*ethics', '*Physician-Patient Relations'];;;;10.1186/s13010-015-0033-x

In cases in which there is an extensive sharing of organs, but nevertheless two distinguishable functioning brains, there are a number of philosophical and ethical challenges. This is because such conjoined twins: 1. give rise to puzzles concerning our identity, about whether we are identical to something psychological or biological; 2. force us to decide whether what matters from an ethical point of view is the biological life of our organisms or the existence of our consciousness or mind; 3. raise questions concerning when, if ever, it is morally acceptable to sacrifice one of us to save another; 4. force us to reflect on the conditions for ownership of organs and the justification of removal of organs for transplantation which causes the death of  the donor; 5. raise questions about who should take decisions about life-risking  treatments when this cannot be decided by patients themselves.

There is no cure for such diseases, although recent experiments suggest that there may be a way to prevent them by genetically altering the eggs or embryos through a procedure known as mitochondrial donation. However, such a procedure not only raises serious safety and ethical concerns, but legal challenges as well, since it involves germline gene modification, which until recently was not legal in the UK or elsewhere. In February 2015, the British Parliament amended the relevant legislation to allow such. a procedure, making the UK the first state to openly challenge the global policy on germline gene modification.

879;26662845;Article;2016;The British journal of surgery;;Kidney and liver transplantation in the elderly.;;BACKGROUND: Transplant surgery is facing a shortage of deceased donor organs. In  response, the criteria for organ donation have been extended, and an increasing number of organs from older donors are being used. For recipients, the benefits of transplantation are great, and the growing ageing population has led to increasing numbers of elderly patients being accepted for transplantation. METHODS: The literature was reviewed to investigate the impact of age of donors and recipients in abdominal organ transplantation, and to highlight aspects of the fine balance in donor and recipient selection and screening, as well as allocation policies fair to young and old alike. RESULTS: Overall, kidney and liver transplantation from older deceased donors have good outcomes, but are not  as good as those from younger donors. Careful donor selection based on risk indices, and potentially biomarkers, special allocation schemes to match elderly  donors with elderly recipients, and vigorous recipient selection, allows good outcomes with increasing age of both donors and recipients. The results of live kidney donation have been excellent for donor and recipient, and there is a trend towards inclusion of older donors. Future strategies, including personalized immunosuppression for older recipients as well as machine preservation and reconditioning of donor organs, are promising ways to improve the outcome of transplantation between older donors and older recipients. CONCLUSION: Kidney and liver transplantation in the elderly is a clinical reality. Outcomes are good, but can be optimized by using strategies that modify donor risk factors and recipient co-morbidities, and personalized approaches to organ allocation and immunosuppression.;;Sutherland AI, IJzermans JN, Forsythe JL, Dor FJ;;eng;['Aged', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression/methods', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*methods', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*methods', 'Living Donors/ethics/statistics & numerical data/supply & distribution', 'Prognosis', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/statistics & numerical data'];;;;10.1002/bjs.10064

However, the  specific patterns of cognitive impairment and association of cognitive dysfunction with activities of daily living and clinical outcomes (including withdrawal from treatment) among haemodialysis patients remain incompletely understood. The COGNITIVE impairment in adults with end-stage kidney disease treated with HemoDialysis (COGNITIVE-HD) study aims to characterise the age-adjusted and education-adjusted patterns of cognitive impairment (using comprehensive testing for executive function, perceptual-motor function, language, learning and memory, and complex attention) in patients on haemodialysis and association with clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective, longitudinal, cohort study of 750 adults with end-stage kidney disease treated with long-term haemodialysis has been recruited within haemodialysis centres in Italy (July 2013 to April 2014). Testing for neurocognitive function was carried out by a trained psychologist at baseline to  assess cognitive functioning. The primary study factor is cognitive impairment and secondary study factors will be specific domains of cognitive function. The primary outcome will be total mortality. Secondary outcomes will be cause-specific mortality, major cardiovascular events, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, institutionalisation, and withdrawal from treatment at 12 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved before study conduct by the following responsible ethics committees: Catania (approval reference 186/BE; 26/09/2013), Agrigento (protocol numbers 61-62; 28/6/2013), USL Roma C (CE 39217; 24/6/2013), USL Roma F (protocol number 0041708; 23/7/2013), USL Latina (protocol number 20090/A001/2011; 12/7/2013), Trapani (protocol number 3413; 16/7/2013) and Brindisi (protocol number 40259; 6/6/2013).

Barriers to establishment of a dedicated long-term donor follow-up data system in the United States include infrastructure costs and donor retention. We propose providing all previous and future living donors with a lifelong health insurance benefit for the primary purpose of facilitating acquisition of health information after donation as an alternative to establishment of a dedicated donor follow-up data system. Donors would consent to allow collection and analysis of their medical data, and continuation of insurance coverage would require completion of regular health assessments. The extension of health insurance would be analogous to the established practice of paying people for participation in a research study and would provide a mechanism to engage donors in a new paradigm of postdonation care in which donors are actively involved in their own health maintenance. Rather than acting as an inducement for donation, providing donors with the ability to easily contribute information about their health status represents a practical strategy to acquire the long-term medical information necessary to better inform  future generations of living kidney donors.;;Newell KA, Formica RN, Gill JS;;eng;['Delivery of Health Care/*standards', 'Humans', '*Insurance, Health', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Motivation', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['donors and donation: living', 'editorial/personal viewpoint', 'ethics and public policy', 'insurance', 'kidney transplantation/nephrology', 'law/legislation', 'organ transplantation in general', 'quality of care/care delivery'];;;10.1111/ajt.13524

The medical community must balance the principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice to  ensure the best interest of the potential donor and to provide equitable benefit  to society. Accordingly, the US Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) has established procedures for the ethical allocation of organs depending  on several donor-specific and recipient-specific factors. To maximize the availability of transplantable organs and opportunities for dying patients and families to donate, the US government has mandated that hospitals refer potential donors in a timely manner. Expedient investigation and diagnosis of brain death where applicable are also crucial, especially in neonates. Empowering trained individuals from organ procurement organizations to discuss organ donation with families has also increased rates of consent. Other efforts to increase organ supply include recovery from donors who die by circulatory criteria (DCDD) in addition to donation after brain death (DBD), and from neonates born with immediately lethal conditions such as anencephaly. Ethical considerations in DCDD compared to DBD include a potential conflict of interest between the dying patient and others who may benefit from the organs, and the precision of the declaration of death of the donor. Most clinicians and ethicists believe in the appropriateness of the Dead Donor Rule, which states that vital organs should only be recovered from people who have died. The medical community can maximize the interests of organ donors and recipients by observing the Dead Donor Rule and acknowledging the ethical considerations in organ donation.;;Sarnaik AA;;eng;;['biomedical ethics', 'brain death', 'dead donor rule', 'donation after circulatory determination of death', 'organ donation'];;;10.3389/fped.2015.00100
884;26630929;Article;2015;BMC medical ethics;;Historical development and current status of organ procurement from death-row prisoners in China.;;"BACKGROUND: In December 2014, China announced that only voluntarily donated organs from citizens would be used for transplantation after January 1, 2015. Many medical professionals worldwide believe that China has stopped using organs  from death-row prisoners. DISCUSSION: In the present article, we briefly review the historical development of organ procurement from death-row prisoners in China and comprehensively analyze the social-political background and the legal basis of the announcement. The announcement was not accompanied by any change in organ  sourcing legislations or regulations. As a fact, the use of prisoner organs remains legal in China. Even after January 2015, key Chinese transplant officials have repeatedly stated that death-row prisoners have the same right as regular citizens to ""voluntarily donate"" organs. This perpetuates an unethical organ procurement system in ongoing violation of international standards. CONCLUSIONS:  Organ sourcing from death-row prisoners has not stopped in China. The 2014 announcement refers to the intention to stop the use of organs illegally harvested without the consent of the prisoners. Prisoner organs procured with ""consent"" are now simply labelled as ""voluntarily donations from citizens"". The semantic switch may whitewash sourcing from both death-row prisoners and prisoners of conscience. China can gain credibility only by enacting new legislation prohibiting use of prisoner organs and by making its organ sourcing system open to international inspections.

We pilot an out-of-hospital uDCDD kidney program for New York City in partnership with communities that it was intended to benefit. We evaluate protocol process and outcomes while identifying barriers to success and means for improvement. METHODS: We conducted  a prospective, participatory action research study in Manhattan from December 2010 to May 2011. Daily from 4 to 12 pm, our organ preservation unit monitored emergency medical services (EMS) frequencies for cardiac arrests occurring in private locations. After EMS providers independently ordered termination of resuscitation, organ preservation unit staff determined clinical eligibility and  donor status. Authorized parties, persons authorized to make organ donation decisions, were approached about in vivo preservation. The study population included organ preservation unit staff, authorized parties, passersby, and other  New York City agency personnel. Organ preservation unit staff independently documented shift activities with daily operations notes and teleconference summaries that we analyzed with mixed qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS: The organ preservation unit entered 9 private locations; all the deceased lacked previous registration, although 4 met clinical screening eligibility. No kidneys were recovered. We collected 837 notes from 35 organ preservation unit staff. Despite frequently recounting protocol breaches, most responses from passersby including New York City agencies were favorable. No authorized parties were offended by preservation requests, yielding a Bayesian posterior median 98% (95% credible interval 76% to 100%). CONCLUSION: In summary, the New York City out-of-hospital uDCDD program was not feasible. There were frequent protocol breaches and confusion in determining clinical eligibility.

Allocation schemes are consistent across the country, and specific policies are publicly vetted. Patient selection criteria are largely in the hands of individual organ transplant programs, and consistent standards are less evident. This has been particularly apparent for patients with developmental disabilities (DDs). In response to concerns regarding the fairness of transplant evaluations for patients with DDs, we developed a transplant centerwide policy using a multidisciplinary, community-based approach. This publication details the particular policy of our center. All patients should receive individualized assessments using consistent standards; disability should be neither a relative nor an absolute contraindication to transplantation. External review can increase trust in the selection process.

As a consequence, the proportion of grafts procured from extended criteria donors (ECD) has increased considerably, but this comes along with increased rates of delayed graft function (DGF) and a higher incidence of immune-mediated rejection that limits organ and patient survival. Furthermore, most grafts are derived from brain dead organ donors, but the unphysiological state of brain death is associated with significant metabolic, hemodynamic, and pro-inflammatory changes, which further compromise patient and graft survival. Thus, donor interventions to preserve graft quality are fundamental to improve long-term transplantation outcome, but interventions must not harm other potentially transplantable grafts. Several donor pretreatment strategies have provided encouraging results in animal models, but evidence from human studies is sparse, as most clinical evidence is derived from single-center or nonrandomized trials. Furthermore, ethical matters  have to be considered especially concerning consent from donors, donor families,  and transplant recipients to research in the field of donor treatment.

Meanwhile, ADPKD can also be regarded as a systemic disease because the  cystic and non-cystic abnormalities could be identified in multiple organs in patients with ADPKD. Several lines of evidence suggest the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus or new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is higher in patients with ADPKD compared with non-ADPKD renal recipients, but the available results are conflicting. We describe the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis for investigating the risk of NODAT in patients with ADPKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library will be searched. Cohort studies irrespective of language and publication status, comparing the incidence of NODAT in renal recipients with ADPKD and other kidney disease will be eligible. We will assess heterogeneity among studies. Along with 95% CIs, dichotomous data will be summarised as risk ratios; numbers needed to treat/harm and continuous data will be given as standard mean differences. Excluding outliers and testing small sample size studies if our results are robust, sensitivity analysis will be carried out.

MRI can detect the presence of oedema non-invasively by quantitatively measuring changes of the transverse relaxation time T2 in the myocardium. Several monocentric studies have shown that T2 quantification could help detect graft rejection in a less invasive way. DRAGET is a national multicentre diagnostic study designed to prove that T2 quantification by MRI can detect graft rejection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 190 patients from 10 centres will undergo T2 quantification and endomyocardial biopsy, within 24 h, 4 to 6 times during the first year after transplantation. T2 will be computed by analysing a sequence of 10 images obtained from a short-axis  slice. Specific phantoms will be used to calibrate the T2 quantification on each  MR scanner to cope with the different equipment (different vendors, magnetic field strength, etc). Specific pads with known T2 will also be used during each examination and provide a quality check to cope with the different experimental conditions (temperature, etc). All MRI and biopsy data will be reinterpreted in our centre and reproducibility will be assessed. The primary outcome will be sensitivity and specificity of MRI. The secondary outcomes will be (1) prognostic values of T2, (2) reproducibility of each techniques, (3) number of adverse events during each procedures and (4) confidence of the physicians in T2. ETHICS  AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained. The new MRI method will be  disseminated at a national level and its practical usefulness will be assessed in centres not familiar with MRI T2 quantification. The ultimate aim of the DRAGET project is to replace a strategy based solely on biopsy with one based on a first-line MRI (with biopsy only when needed) for a more efficient and less invasive detection of rejection.

897;26497322;Article;2015;Life sciences, society and policy;;Islet Xeno/transplantation and the risk of contagion: local responses from Canada and Australia to an emerging global technoscience.;;This paper situates the public debate over the use of living animal organs and tissue for human therapies within the history of experimental islet transplantation. Specifically, the paper compares and contrasts the Canadian and  Australian responses on xenotransplantation to consider what lessons can be learnt about the regulation of a complex and controversial biotechnology. Sobbrio and Jorqui described public engagement on xenotransplantation in these countries  as 'important forms of experimental democracy.' While Canada experimented with a  novel nation-wide public consultation, Australia sought public input within the context of a national inquiry. In both instances, the outcome was a temporary moratorium on all forms of clinical xenotransplantation comparable to the policies adopted in some European countries. In addition, the Australian xenotransplantation ban coincided with a temporary global ban on experimental islet allotransplantation in 2007. Through historical and comparative research, this paper investigates how public controversies over organ and tissue transplantation can inform our understanding of the mediation of interspeciality  and the regulation of a highly contested technoscience. It offers an alternative  perspective on the xenotransplantation controversy by exploring the ways in which coinciding moratoriums on islet allograft and xenograft challenge, complicate and confound our assumptions regarding the relationships between human and animal, between routine surgery and clinical experimentation, between biomedical science  and social science, and between disease risks and material contagion.;;Cheng M;;eng;['Animals', 'Australia', 'Biotechnology/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence/trends', 'Canada', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Community Participation', 'Contraindications', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Europe', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/*methods', 'Public Opinion', 'Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/trends', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/adverse effects/*legislation & jurisprudence/*trends', 'Transplantation, Homologous/legislation & jurisprudence/trends'];['Moratorium', 'Public consultation', 'Research governance', 'Scientific controversies', 'Xenotransplantation'];;;10.1186/s40504-015-0030-2

We surveyed transplant surgeons (n = 294), organ procurement organization (OPO) professionals (n = 83), and institutional review board (IRB) members (n = 317) and found wide variations in their perceptions about research classification, risk assessment for donors and organ transplant recipients, regulatory oversight requirements, and informed consent in the context of deceased donor intervention research. For  instance, when presented with different research scenarios, IRB members were more likely than transplant surgeons and OPO professionals to feel that study review and oversight were necessary by the IRBs at the investigator, donor, and transplant center hospitals.

If the burden of proof is not met,  it is claimed, then the policy in question should be accepted. This article illustrates, and critically evaluates, examples of this strategy in debates about the sale of organs by living donors, human enhancement, and the precautionary principle.

We examined  attitudes of transplant surgeons and transplant nephrologists regarding greater disclosure. METHODS: Web-based and mailed surveys to explore attitudes about disclosing potential recipient health information, health-associated behaviors, and lifestyle choices to living donors. RESULTS: Of 397 potential participants, 111 eligible participants (28%) fully or partially responded. Respondents were split between surgeons (42%) and nephrologists (58%). While 72% believed that general disclosure did not require explicit permission, 88% believed that disclosure of specific recipient information did. Many would disclose more information if legally permissible. Over 65% thought disclosure of recipient information should not depend on the donor-recipient relationship. Virtually all  supported disclosing expected one- and five-yr graft survival and anticipated deceased donor wait-time. Sixty-six percent supported disclosing non-compliance or difficulty taking medications. Support was divided for disclosure of HIV (52%), hepatitis (49%), smoking (53%), illicit drugs (50%), alcohol (49%), and psychiatric history (44%).

These survivors require lifelong cardiology care and must assume self-management responsibilities with respect to  their health. Accordingly, we sought to assess psychosocial maturity and validity of the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) in this population. DESIGN: The study was designed as a cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: The study was set at tertiary-care pediatric and adult cardiology clinics in Edmonton and Toronto, Canada. PATIENTS: The patients were 18- to 25-year-olds with moderate or complex CHD or a HTx in childhood. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed validated instruments including the TRAQ, Erickson's Psychosocial Stage Inventory (EPSI), and Kenny's Parental Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ). RESULTS: We enrolled 188 participants (41% women), 109 (58%) having moderate CHD, 64 (34%) complex CHD, and 15 (8%) with a HTx. Mean age for those followed in a pediatric clinic was 21.3 +/- 2.3 years, compared with 21.8 +/- 2.3 years for those attending an adult clinic (P = 0.20). All questionnaire scores were similar among participants with moderate CHD vs. complex CHD vs. an HTx, and among participants followed in a pediatric clinic vs. an adult clinic. EPSI and PAQ scores were similar to those of healthy populations, though perception of maternal overprotection was common. TRAQ scores increased with age. A response of ""not needed for my care"" to 5 or more of the 29 TRAQ items was provided by 110 (75%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: Age, but not disease severity should be a factor when considering the transition needs of young adults with heart disease. The TRAQ has important limitations in the adult CHD/HTx population and a cardiac-specific measure of transition readiness is needed.";;Mackie AS, Rempel GR, Islam S, Rankin K, McCurdy C, Vonder Muhll I, Magill-Evans J, Nicholas D, Kovacs AH;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/*standards', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Heart Transplantation/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents/psychology', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplant Recipients/*psychology', 'Young Adult'];['Adult', 'Congenital Heart Disease', 'Quality of Life', 'Transition of Care'];;;10.1111/chd.12300

910;26381492;Article;2015;Xenotransplantation;;Justifying clinical trials for porcine islet xenotransplantation.;;The development of the Edmonton Protocol encouraged a great deal of optimism that a cell-based cure for type I diabetes could be achieved. However, donor organ shortages prevent islet transplantation from being a widespread solution as the supply cannot possibly equal the demand. Porcine islet xenotransplantation has the potential to address these shortages, and recent preclinical and clinical trials show promising scientific support. Consequently, it is important to consider whether the current science meets the ethical requirements for moving toward clinical trials. Despite the potential risks and the scientific unknowns that remain to be investigated, there is optimism regarding the xenotransplantation of some types of tissue, and enough evidence has been gathered to ethically justify clinical trials for the most safe and advanced area of research, porcine islet transplantation. Researchers must make a concerted effort to maintain a positive image for xenotransplantation, as a few well-publicized failed trials could irrevocably damage public perception of xenotransplantation. Because all of society carries the burden of risk, it is important that the public be involved in the decision to proceed. As new information from preclinical and clinical trials develops, policy decisions should be frequently updated. If at any point evidence shows that islet xenotransplantation is unsafe, then clinical trials will no longer be justified and they should be halted. However, as of now, the expected benefit of an unlimited supply of islets, combined with adequate informed consent, justifies clinical trials for islet xenotransplantation.;;Ellis CE, Korbutt GS;;eng;['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*ethics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/ethics/*methods', 'Swine', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*ethics'];['clinical trials', 'diabetes', 'islet transplantation', 'public health policy', 'xenotransplantation'];;;10.1111/xen.12196

The authors analyzed the costs resulting from the increased movement of allografts related to this new policy. Using a sample of nine organ procurement organizations, representing 17% of the US population and 19% of the deceased donors in 2013, data were obtained on import and export costs before Share 35 implementation (June 15, 2012, to June 14, 2013) and after Share  35 implementation (June 15, 2013, to June 14, 2014). Results showed that liver import rates increased 42%, with an increased cost of 51%, while export rates increased 112%, with an increased cost of 127%. When the costs of importing and exporting allografts were combined, the total change in costs for all nine organ  procurement organizations was $11 011 321 after Share 35 implementation.

An overview  of the main clinical, organisational, ethical and legal issues concerning organ donation after circulatory death in Italy.";;Donation after circulatory death (DCD) is a valuable option for the procurement of functioning organs for transplantation. Clinical results are promising and public acceptance is quite good in most western countries. Yet, although DCD is widespread in Europe, several problems still persist in Italy as well as in some  other countries. This paper aims to describe the main clinical, organisational, ethical and legal issues at stake, bearing in mind the particular situation created by Italian legislation. Currently, as regards DCD, Italy is somewhat different from other countries. Therefore, every effort should be made for the safe and effective implementation of DCD programs: uncontrolled DCD programs should be promoted and encouraged, within the framework of shared and authoritative rules. At the same time, we need to tackle the question of controlled DCD, promoting debate among all involved subjects regarding the fundamental issues of end-of-life care within protocols that best integrate the highest standard of care for the dying and the legitimate interests of those awaiting a life-saving organ.;;Giannini A, Abelli M, Azzoni G, Biancofiore G, Citterio F, Geraci P, Latronico N, Picozzi M, Procaccio F, Riccioni L, Rigotti P, Valenza F, Vesconi S, Zamperetti N;;eng;['Attitude', 'Death', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Terminal Care', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence/psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;

These situations have raised important questions in medical ethics; are these applications completely prohibited according to these perspectives, and is there any room for mitigation? This paper explores the concept of darurah (necessity) and its deliberation in the formulation of fatwas on medicine issued by the National Fatwa Council of Malaysia. Darurah has explicitly been taken into consideration in the formulation of 14 out of 45 fatwas on medicine thus far, including one of the latest fatwas regarding uterine donation and transplantation. These fatwas are not only limited to the issues regarding the use of unlawful things as remedies. They include issues pertaining to organ transplantation, management of the corpse and treatment of brain dead patients. While deliberation of darurah in medicine may vary from issue to issue, darurah applies in a dire situation in which there are  no lawful means to prevent harm that may be inflicted upon human life.

Searches will be performed  using the following electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, CINHAL, EMBASE, Cochrane library and Web of Science. Reports of original research will be eligible for inclusion if they are published from 2005 to present, written or available in English language, performed in the USA, enrol adult participants (18 years of age or more), and employ descriptive or observational designs. Two authors will independently screen retrieved articles for inclusion. MaxQDA will be used for data analysis and management. All included reports will be coded for  article characteristics; disparities identified; barriers and motivators of completion of steps to transplantation; and proposed solutions to disparities and barriers. Each report will be coded independently by two authors and discrepancies resolved by discussion among the full team. A qualitative approach  to data analysis is planned. Risk of bias will be assessed using standard procedures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The findings will provide crucial information on the current status of disparities in access to transplantation. PRISMA guidelines will be followed in reporting the results of the review. It is  anticipated that these results will inform research which seeks to increase parity in access to transplantation.

918;26350881;Article;2016;Journal of autoimmunity;;An update on liver transplantation: A critical review.;;Liver transplantation, although now a routine procedure, with defined indications and usually excellent outcomes, still has challenges. Donor shortage remains a key issue. Transplanted organs are not free of risk and may transmit cancer, infection, metabolic or autoimmune disease. Approaches to the donor shortage include use of organs from donors after circulatory death, from living donors and from those previously infected with Hepatitis B and C and even HIV for selected recipients. Normothermic regional and/or machine perfusion, whether static or pulsatile, normo- or hypothermic, are being explored and will be likely to have a major place in improving donation rates and outcomes. The main indications for liver replacement are alcoholic liver disease, HCV, non-alcoholic liver disease and liver cancer. Recent studies have shown that selected patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis may also benefit from liver transplant. The advent of new and highly effective treatments for HCV, whether given before or after transplant will have a major impact on outcomes. The role of transplantation for those with  liver cell cancer continues to evolve as other interventions become more effective. Immunosuppression is usually required life-long and adherence remains  a challenge, especially in adolescents. Immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors (primarily tacrolimus), antimetabolites (azathioprine or mycophenolate) and corticosteroids remains standard. Outcomes after transplantation are good but not normal in quality or quantity. Premature death may be due to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, de novo cancer, recurrent disease or late technical problems.;;Neuberger J;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites/therapeutic use', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Donor Selection/ethics', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Liver Diseases/*surgery', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Perfusion/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation Tolerance', 'Treatment Outcome'];['De novo cancer', 'Death', 'Donation after circulatory', 'Liver transplantation', 'Machine perfusion', 'Recurrent disease'];;;10.1016/j.jaut.2015.08.021

921;26307344;Article;2016;Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation;;Determination of Eligibility in Related Pediatric Hematopoietic Cell Donors: Ethical and Clinical Considerations. Recommendations from a Working Group of the  Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Association.;;Related donors for hematopoietic cell (HC) transplantation are a growing population in recent years because of expanding indications for allogeneic transplantation. The safety and welfare of the donor are major concerns for the transplantation community, especially for related sibling donors of young recipients who are children and, thus, not able to fully consent. Because donation of HC does not improve the donor's own physical health and carries a risk of side effects, careful assessment of medical risks specific to the individual donor, as well as consideration of ethical and legal aspects associated with donation from a child, must be considered. In addition, donor centers must balance the needs of both the donor and the recipient, understanding the inherent conflict parents may have as they can be overly focused on the very  sick child receiving a transplant, rather than on the relatively less significant health or emotional problems that a sibling donor may have, which could impact risk with donation. Likewise, consideration must be made regarding the nature of  the relationship of the sibling donor to the recipient and also aspects of performing research on pediatric HC donors. In this article, as members of the Donor Issues Committee of the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we review key ethical concerns associated with pediatric donation and then give recommendations for screening potential child donors with  underlying health conditions. These recommendations are aimed at protecting the physical and emotional well-being of childhood donors and arise out of the Third  International Conference on Health and Safety of Donors sponsored by the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.;;Bitan M, van Walraven SM, Worel N, Ball LM, Styczynski J, Torrabadella M, Witt V, Shaw BE, Seber A, Yabe H, Greinix HT, Peters C, Gluckman E, Rocha V, Halter J, Pulsipher MA;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Allografts', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Donor Selection/*ethics/*methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*ethics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics'];['Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell donor', 'Pediatric organ donation'];;;10.1016/j.bbmt.2015.08.017

Experimental evidence indicates that remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) provides systemic protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury in various tissues. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 'Remote ischaemic conditioning in renal transplantation--effect on immediate and extended kidney graft function' (the CONTEXT study) is an investigator initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled trial investigating whether RIC of the leg of the recipient improves short and long-term graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. The study will include  200 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after brain death and 20 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after circulatory death. Participants are randomised in a 1:1 design to RIC or sham-RIC (control). RIC consists of four cycles of 5 min occlusion of the thigh by a tourniquet inflated  to 250 mm Hg, separated by 5 min of deflation. Primary end point is the time to a 50% reduction from the baseline plasma creatinine, estimated from the changes of  plasma creatinine values 30 days post-transplant or 30 days after the last performed dialysis post-transplant. Secondary end points are: need of dialysis post-transplant, measured and estimated-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 3 and 12 months after transplantation, patient and renal graft survival, number of rejection episodes in the first year, and changes in biomarkers of acute kidney injury and inflammation in plasma, urine and graft tissue. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the local ethical committees and national data security agencies. Results are expected to be published in 2016.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of fluid replacement solutions used intraoperatively on renal functions in elective living-donor liver transplantation. METHODS: After Ethics Committee approval, informed consents were obtained from patients. Patients with normal renal functions and scheduled for elective living-donor-liver transplantation were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to infusion with 6% hydroxyehylstarch 130/40 (HES group) and 4% Gelofusine (GEL group). Blood samples were obtained before the induction of anesthesia (baseline), at the end of the operation, and postoperative days 1 and 4. Different estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) formulas using creatinine (modification of renal disease,  chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration and Cockraud Gault) were used to calculate the eGFR. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study (GEL group = 18; HES group = 18). Patient characteristics, modified end stage liver disease-Child Pugh score, American Society of anaesthesiologist scores, and intraoperative data were similar between groups. Postoperative measurements showed that creatinine was significantly higher in the GEL group compared with the baseline, which was not the case for the HES group. Similarly, postoperative  eGFR levels, as measured using MDRD and CKD-EPI, were found to be significantly lower in the GEL group. Postoperative urine albumin:creatinine ratios were significantly higher in the GEL group compared with baseline. Total crystalloid amount used, colloid, blood, fresh frozen plasma values, extubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay were similar in both groups. Postreperfusion syndrome developed in 6 patients in each group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Gelofusine seem to cause more impairment in renal functions in elective living-donor liver transplantation.";;Demir A, Aydinli B, Toprak HI, Karadeniz U, Yilmaz FM, Zungun C, Ucar P, Guclu CY, Bostanci EB, Yilmaz S;;eng;['Adult', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Gelatin/*administration & dosage', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyethyl Starch Derivatives', 'Infusions, Intravenous', '*Liver Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Starch/*administration & dosage'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.05.015

This review highlights the ethical considerations and challenges at each stage of research, by comparing issues surrounding two translational tissue engineering technologies: the bioartificial pancreas and a tissue engineered skeletal muscle construct. We present relevant ethical issues and questions to consider at each step along the translational pathway, from the  basic science bench to preclinical research to first-in-human clinical trials. Topics at the bench level include maintaining data integrity, appropriate reporting and dissemination of results, and ensuring that studies are designed to yield results suitable for advancing research. Topics in preclinical research include the principle of ""modest translational distance"" and appropriate animal models. Topics in clinical research include key issues that arise in early-stage  clinical trials, including selection of patient-subjects, disclosure of uncertainty, and defining success.

928;26272355;Article;2015;Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN;;Disclosing Health and Health Behavior Information between Living Donors and Their Recipients.;;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Living donor guidelines-both national and international-either do not address or are vague about what information can be shared between prospective living donors and transplant candidates, as well as when to make such disclosures and who should make them. This study explored the attitudes of donors and recipients regarding how much information they believe should be shared. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Two Email invitations were sent by the National Kidney Foundation (national headquarters) to its Email listservs, inviting members to participate in an online survey to assess the attitudes of kidney transplant stakeholders regarding the disclosure of health and health risk behavior information. RESULTS: From approximately 4200  unique Email addresses, 392 (9.3%) respondents completed part or all of the survey. The analyses were limited to the 236 respondents who self-identified as either donors (potential and actual, n=160) or recipients (candidates and actual, n=76). Overall, 79% (186 of 234) of respondents supported disclosure of general recipient health information that would affect post-transplant outcome to donors, and 88% (207 of 235) supported disclosure of general donor health information to  recipients. Recipients and donors were also supportive of sharing donor and recipient information, particularly information relevant to graft and patient survival. There is some reticence, however, about sharing social information. The closer the relationship, the more information they are willing to share. Both donors and recipients wanted the transplant team involved in the information disclosure. Over three quarters of donors (79%) and recipients (78%) did not think the recipient had a right to know why a donor was excluded from donating. CONCLUSIONS: Both donors and recipients want a significant amount of health information to be disclosed.

While the prevalence of this form of organ donation continues to increase, many thorny ethical issues remain, often creating moral distress in both clinicians and families. In this article, we address one of these issues, namely, the challenges surrounding patient and surrogate informed consent for donation after  circulatory determination of death.

930;26204418;Article;2015;Annals of transplantation;;Ultrasound/Laparoscopic Camera-Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block for Renal Transplant Donors: A Randomized Controlled Trial.;;BACKGROUND: The most common treatment modality for postoperative pain relief following laparoscopic surgery is multimodal, using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids, and infiltration of local anesthetics. Because NSAIDs are nephrotoxic, local infiltration does not relieve deep tissue pain, and opioids have an adverse effects profile including pruritus, nausea, vomiting, oversedation, apnea, and decreased gastrointestinal motility. Therefore, the use  of a regional analgesic technique can lead to an improved quality of recovery. The aim of this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the effect of TAP block on postoperative verbal analog scale (VAS) scores and total morphine requirements in the first 24 hours after laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After obtaining approval from the hospital ethics committee and written informed consent from the patients, 49 ASA I-II patients undergoing laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, aged 18 years or over, were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. In this clinical trial patients were divided into 2 groups: TAP block group (group T) and placebo  group (group P). The demographic variables, pain scores, morphine consumption, level of sedation, presence of postoperative nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and average length of postoperative stay were reviewed. RESULTS: The pain scores were significantly lower after TAP block with bupivacaine at most but not all time points. Patients receiving the TAP block with bupivacaine required less morphine  up to 24 hours after surgery compared with the saline group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the local  medical research ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained. Twenty-one patients with end-stage renal disease (15 men, six women; mean age +/- standard deviation, 32 years +/- 9.5) who were scheduled to undergo renal transplantation and 21 healthy control subjects (15 men, six women; mean age, 31  years +/- 6.5) were included. Diffusion-tensor imaging and resting-state functional MR imaging were performed in all subjects. Patients were imaged both before and 1 month after renal transplantation. Structural (mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, path length, and number of tracts derived from diffusion-tensor imaging tractography) and functional (temporal correlation coefficient derived from resting-state functional MR imaging) connectivity of the DMN were quantitatively compared with two-sample t tests or paired t tests. Intergroup correlation analysis was performed to compare structural or functional indexes and results of neuropsychological or blood biochemistry tests. RESULTS: Mean diffusivity was decreased in the fiber bundles connecting the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus to the bilateral inferior parietal lobules in  patients after renal transplantation compared with that in patients before transplantation (P < .05). Temporal correlation coefficients for patients after renal transplantation nearly reached the levels of those for control subjects (all, P > .05). The change in mean diffusivity of the fiber bundles connecting the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus to the right inferior parietal lobule positively correlated with the change in hematocrit levels (r = 0.522, P = .015), the change in temporal correlation coefficients between the posterior cingulate cortex or precuneus and left or right inferior parietal lobules correlated with changes in number connection test type A scores (r = -0.549, P =  .010) and digit symbol test scores (r = 0.533, P = .013). CONCLUSION: Functional  connectivity changes in the DMN, which were associated with improved hematocrit levels and cognitive function, may recover earlier than structural connectivity changes do 1 month after renal transplantation.";;Zhang LJ, Wen J, Liang X, Qi R, Schoepf UJ, Wichmann JL, Milliken CM, Chen HJ, Kong X, Lu GM;;eng;['Adult', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', 'Kidney Function Tests', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests'];;;;10.1148/radiol.2015150004

Cultural inheritance makes possible for humans what no other organism can accomplish: the  cumulative transmission of experience from generation to generation. In turn, cultural inheritance leads to cultural evolution, the prevailing mode of human adaptation. For the last few millennia, humans have been adapting the environments to their genes more often than their genes to the environments. Nevertheless, natural selection persists in modern humans, both as differential mortality and as differential fertility, although its intensity may decrease in the future. More than 2,000 human diseases and abnormalities have a genetic causation.

Germ-line gene therapy could halt this increase, but at present, it is not technically feasible.

934;26194324;Article;2016;Bioethics;;When Opportunity Knocks Twice: Dual Living Kidney Donation, Autonomy and the Public Interest.;;Living kidney transplantation offers the best treatment in terms of life-expectancy and quality of life for those with end-stage renal disease. The long-term risks of living donor nephrectomy, although real, are very small, with  evidence of good medium-term outcomes. Who should be entitled to donate, and in which circumstances, is nevertheless a live question. We explore the ethical dimensions of a request by an individual to donate both of their kidneys during life: 'dual living kidney donation'. Our ethical analysis is tethered to a hypothetical case study in which a father asks to donate a kidney to each of his  twin boys. We explore the autonomy of the protagonists, alongside different dimensions of the public interest, such as the need to protect not only the recipients, but also the donor and even the wider community. Whilst acknowledging objections to 'dual-donation', not least by reference to the harms that the donor might be expected to endure, we suggest there is a prima facie case for permitting this, provided that both donor and recipients are willing and that due attention is paid to such considerations as the autonomy and welfare of all parties, as well as to the wider ramifications of acting on such a request. We argue for broader interpretations of the concepts of autonomy and welfare, recognizing the importance of relationships and the relevance of more than merely physical well-being. Equipped with such a holistic assessment, we suggest there is a prima facie case for allowing 'dual living kidney donation'.;;Bailey P, Huxtable R;;eng;['Ethics, Medical', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Freedom', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/ethnology/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Living Donors/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nephrectomy/ethics', 'Nuclear Family', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Values', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics', '*Transplant Recipients/psychology', 'United States'];['autonomy', 'liberty', 'living kidney donation', 'medical ethics', 'public interest', 'slippery slopes', 'transplantation', 'welfare'];;DRF-2013-06-031/Department of Health/United Kingdom;10.1111/bioe.12177
935;26174971;Article;2015;Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the  Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society;;Age and equity in liver transplantation: An organ allocation model.;;"A moral liver allocation policy must be fair. We considered a 2-step, 2-principle allocation system called ""age mapping."" Its first principle, equal opportunity, ensures that candidates of all ages have an equal chance of getting an organ. Its second principle, prudential lifespan equity, allocates younger donor grafts to younger candidates and older donors to older candidates in order to increase the  likelihood that all recipients achieve a ""full lifespan."" Data from 2476 candidates and 1371 consecutive adult liver transplantations (from 1999 to 2012)  were used to determine whether age mapping can reduce the gap in years of life lost (YLL) between younger and older recipients. A parametric Weibull prognostic  model was developed to estimate total life expectancy after transplantation using survival of the general population matched by sex and age as a reference. Life expectancy from birth was calculated by adding age at transplant and total life expectancy after transplantation. In multivariate analysis, recipient age, hepatitis C virus status, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score at transplant of >30, and donor age were significantly related to prognosis after surgery (P <  0.05). The mean (and standard deviation) number of years of life from birth, calculated from the current allocation model, for various age groups were: recipients 18-47 years (n = 340) = 65.2 (3.3); 48-55 years (n = 387) = 72.7 (2.1); 56-61 years (n = 372) = 74.7 (1.7) and for recipients >61 years (n = 272)  = 77.4 (1.4). The total number of YLL equaled 523 years. Redistributing liver grafts, using an age mapping algorithm, reduces the lifespan gap between younger  and older candidates by 33% (from 12.3% to 8.3%) and achieves a 14% overall reduction of YLL (73 years) compared to baseline liver distribution. In conclusion, deliberately incorporating age into an allocation algorithm promotes  fairness and increases efficiency.";;Cucchetti A, Ross LF, Thistlethwaite JR Jr, Vitale A, Ravaioli M, Cescon M, Ercolani G, Burra P, Cillo U, Pinna AD;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Health Equity/*organization & administration', 'Health Services Accessibility/*organization & administration', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liver Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Policy Making', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1002/lt.24211

Functional status might be useful for identifying which patients will derive a survival benefit from transplantation versus dialysis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of wait-listed patients using data for functional status from a national dialysis provider linked to United Network for Organ Sharing registry data. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult kidney transplantation candidates added to the waiting list between 2000 and 2006. PREDICTOR: Physical Functioning scale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, analyzed as a time-varying covariate. OUTCOMES: Kidney transplantation; survival  benefit of transplantation versus remaining wait-listed. MEASUREMENTS: We used multivariable Cox regression to assess the association between physical function  with study outcomes. In survival benefit analyses, transplantation status was modeled as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 19,242 kidney  transplantation candidates (median age, 51 years; 36% black race) receiving maintenance dialysis. Candidates in the lowest baseline Physical Functioning score quartile were more likely to be inactivated (adjusted HR vs highest quartile, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.39) and less likely to undergo transplantation (adjusted HR vs highest quartile, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.61-0.68). After transplantation, worse Physical Functioning score was associated with shorter 3-year survival (84% vs 92% for the lowest vs highest function quartiles). However, compared to dialysis, transplantation was associated with a statistically significant survival benefit by 9 months for patients in every function quartile. LIMITATIONS: Functional status is self-reported. CONCLUSIONS:  Even patients with low function appear to live longer with kidney transplantation versus dialysis. For wait-listed patients, global health measures such as functional status may be more useful in counseling patients about the probability of transplantation than in identifying who will derive a survival benefit from it.";;Reese PP, Shults J, Bloom RD, Mussell A, Harhay MN, Abt P, Levine M, Johansen KL, Karlawish JT, Feldman HI;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality/*surgery/therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Time-to-Treatment/*statistics & numerical data', '*Waiting Lists'];['36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)', 'End-stage renal disease (ESRD)', 'dialysis', 'functional status', 'kidney transplant allocation', 'kidney transplantation', 'physical function', 'post-transplantation complications', 'renal replacement therapy modality', 'survival benefit', 'transplant waiting list'];;K24-DK085153/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.05.015

As  the demand for organs increases, it is essential to ensure that new and innovative laws, policies and strategies of increasing organ supply are bioethical and are founded on the principles of altruism and utilitarianism. In the field of organ transplantation, role of altruism and medical ethics values are significant to the welfare of the society. This article reviews several fundamental ethical principles, prevailing organ donation consent laws, incentives and policies related to the field of transplantation. The Ethical and  Policy Considerations in Organ Donation after Circulatory Determination of Death  outline criteria for death and organ retrieval. Presumed consent laws prevalent mostly in European countries maintain that the default choice of an individual would be to donate organs unless opted otherwise. Explicit consent laws require organ donation to be proactively affirmed with state registries. The Declaration  of Istanbul outlines principles against organ trafficking and transplant tourism. World Health Organization's Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation aim at ensuring transparency in organ procurement and allocation. The ethics of financial incentives and non-financial incentives such as incorporation of non-medical criteria in organ priority allocation have also been reviewed in detail.;;Dalal AR;;eng;;['Ethics', 'Incentives for donation', 'Organ donation', 'Organ trade', 'Presumed and explicit consent', 'Transplantation'];;;10.5500/wjt.v5.i2.44

The system for organ allocation varies by country based on local laws, priorities, and resources. Adjustments are made to optimize allocation, enhance post-transplant survival benefit, decrease unequal transplant access, and optimize utilization of donated kidneys. Allocation of deceased donor kidneys is  based on several criteria; however, the final decision to accept or reject the offered kidney is made by the potential recipient's transplant team (surgeon/nephrologist). Several considerations including assessment of the donor  quality, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between the donor and the recipient, numerous recipient factors, the geographical location of the recipient, and the organ all affect the decision to accept the organ or not for a particular recipient. This decision must be made quickly, often on the spot. Maximizing the benefit from this scarce resource raises difficult ethical issues. The philosophies of equity and utility are often competing.

The notion of the beauty contest in transplantation was recently used by  Neidich et al who stated that '[a]ltruism should be the guiding motivation for all donations, and when it [is], there is no place for a beauty contest'. I examine this beauty contest objection from two perspectives. First, I argue that, when considered against the behaviour of donors, this objection cannot be consistently raised without also objecting to other common aspects of organ donation. I then explore the beauty contest objection from the perspective of recipients, and argue that if the beauty contest is objectionable, it is because  of a tension between recipient behaviour and the altruism that supposedly underpins the donation system. I conclude by briefly questioning the importance of this tension in light of the organ shortage.;;Moorlock G;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Directed Tissue Donation/*ethics', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Humans', '*Living Donors/psychology', '*Motivation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];['Allocation of Organs/Tissues', 'Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1136/medethics-2014-102230

Many countries have explored the option of uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) in order to expand the donor pool. Little is known regarding the variability of practices and outcomes between existing protocols. This systematic review addresses this knowledge gap informing policy makers, researchers, and clinicians for future protocol implementation. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar electronic databases from 2005 to March 2015 as well as the reference lists of selected studies, abstracts, unpublished reports, personal libraries, professional organization reports, and government agency statements on uDCD. We contacted leading authors and organizations to request their protocols and guidelines. Two reviewers extracted  main variables. In studies reporting transplant outcomes, we added type, quantity, quality of organs procured, and complications reported. Internal validity and the quality of the studies reporting outcomes were assessed, as were the methodological rigour and transparency in which a guideline was developed. The review was included in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (Prospero, CRD42014015258). RESULTS: Six guidelines and 18 outcome studies were analysed. The six guidelines are based on limited evidence and major differences exist between them at each step of the uDCD process. The outcome studies report good results for kidney, liver, and lung transplantation with high discard rates for livers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite procedural, medical, economic, legal, and ethical challenges, the uDCD strategy is a viable option for increasing the organ donation pool. Variations in practice and heterogeneity of outcomes preclude a meta-analysis and prevented the linking of outcomes to specific uDCD protocols. Further standardization of protocols and outcomes is required, as is further research into the role of extracorporeal resuscitation and other novel therapies for treatment of some refractory cardiac arrest. It is  essential to ensure the maintenance of trust in uDCD programs by health professionals and the public.;;Ortega-Deballon I, Hornby L, Shemie SD;;eng;['*Death, Sudden, Cardiac', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Systematic Reviews as Topic', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1186/s13054-015-0985-7

The solutions to the shortage of organs proffered by opponents of financial incentives fail to account for a panoply of clinical, regulatory, and financial realities of transplantation centers in the United States in ways that undermine the thesis that a trial of financial incentives for organ procurement is not warranted at this time.

The aim of this study was to assess the level of knowledge, awareness, and attitudes of medical, law, divinity, nursing, and communication students, who will be involved in this issue in the future, regarding brain death and organ donation. METHODS: Data were collected with the use of a 30-item questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 341 participants, 228 (66.8%) were female and overall average age was 21.6 +/- 2.8 years. Nearly one-half of them (51.3%), especially nursing and medical students, wanted to be a donor, but  only 2% had an organ donation card; 78.3% emphasized that family must have the right to make the decision for organ donation, and the vast majority of the participants considered that the organs could not be taken without any permission. Kidney and heart were the most commonly identified transplantable organs; the less frequently known organ was intestine. Only 71 participants, most of them medical, divinity, and law students, correctly answered all questions about brain death; 68.6% stated that organ donation is allowed by religion, and 5% expressed that it is religiously forbidden; 37.3% did not have confidence in health care policy. Law students were more confident, nursing students less confident.

Donors in developed countries have a similar life expectancy and quality of life as healthy non-donors. Living kidney donation is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease, although this outcome is uncommon (<0.5% increase in incidence at 15 years). Kidney donation seems to elevate the risks of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. Many donors incur financial expenses due to factors such as lost wages, need for sick  days, and travel expenses. Yet, most donors have no regrets about donation. Living kidney donation is practised ethically when informed consent incorporates  information about risks, uncertainty about outcomes is acknowledged when it exists, and a donor's risks are proportional to benefits for the donor and recipient. Future research should determine whether outcomes are similar for donors from developing countries and donors with pre-existing conditions such as  obesity.;;Reese PP, Boudville N, Garg AX;;eng;['African Continental Ancestry Group/ethnology', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Contraindications', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility/ethics/trends', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/trends', 'Life Expectancy', 'Living Donors/*ethics/supply & distribution', 'Motivation', 'Oceanic Ancestry Group/ethnology', 'Patient Selection', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/etiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;;10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62484-3

The purpose of this study was to investigate the decision-making process and informational and decisional needs of patients and their caregivers regarding left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. METHODS: In-depth, structured interviews with LVAD patients, candidates and caregivers (spouse, family members) (n = 45) were conducted. We also administered a Decisional Regret Scale. RESULTS: Participants reported LVAD decision-making to be quick and reflexive (n = 30), and deferred heavily to clinicians (n = 22). They did not perceive themselves as having a real choice (n = 28). The 2 most prevalent informational domains that participants identified were lifestyle issues (23 items), followed by technical (drive-line, battery) issues (14 items). Participants easily and clearly identified their values: life extension; family;  and mobility. Participants reported the need to meet other patients and caregivers before device placement (n = 31), and to have an involved caregiver (n = 28) to synthesize information. Some participants demonstrated a lack of clarity regarding transplant probability: 9 of 15 patients described themselves as on a transplant trajectory, yet 7 of these were destination therapy patients. Finally, we found that decisional regret scores were low (1.307). CONCLUSIONS: Informed consent and shared-decision making should: (a) help patients offered highly invasive technologies for life-threatening disease get past the initial ""anything to avoid thinking about death"" reaction and make a more informed decision; (b) clarify transplant status; and (c) focus on lifestyle and technical issues, as patients have the most informational needs in these domains.";;Blumenthal-Barby JS, Kostick KM, Delgado ED, Volk RJ, Kaplan HM, Wilhelms LA, McCurdy SA, Estep JD, Loebe M, Bruce CR;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude', 'Caregivers/*psychology', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/therapy', 'Heart Transplantation', '*Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Interview, Psychological', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patients/*psychology'];['caregivers', 'decision making', 'heart failure', 'informed consent', 'shared decision making', 'transplant', 'ventricular assist device'];;U18 HS024849/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;10.1016/j.healun.2015.03.026

To answer this question, we review the literature on brain-dead organ donors, conduct an ethical analysis, and make recommendations. We conclude that OP-CPR can benefit patients and families by fulfilling the wish to donate. However, it is an aggressive procedure that can cause physical damage to patients, and risks psychological harm to families and healthcare professionals. In a brain-dead organ donor, OP-CPR is acceptable without specific informed consent to OP-CPR, although advance discussion with next of kin regarding this possibility is strongly advised. In a  patient where brain death is yet to be determined, but there is known wish for organ donation, OP-CPR would only be acceptable with a specific informed consent  from the next of kin.

This argument from life-saving necessity is implicit in many incentive proposals, but  rarely challenged by opponents. The core empirical claims on which it rests are thus rarely interrogated: that the gap between supply of and demand for donor kidneys is large and growing, the current system cannot meet demand, and financial incentives would increase the overall supply of kidneys and thus save lives. We consider these claims in the context of the United States. While we acknowledge the plausibility of claims that incentives, if sufficiently large, may successfully recruit greater numbers of living donors, we argue that strategies compatible with the existing altruistic system may also increase the supply of kidneys and save lives otherwise lost to kidney failure. We conclude that current appeals to the life-saving necessity argument have yet to establish  sufficient grounds to justify trials of incentives.;;Martin DE, White SL;;eng;['*Altruism', '*Financial Support', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*economics', 'Living Donors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Motivation', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/organization & administration'];['Kidney transplantation', 'altruistic organ donation', 'end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', 'financial incentives', 'living donors', 'medical ethics', 'organ procurement', 'transplant waiting list'];;;10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.03.041

One ethical concern is the risk that they may be pressured by parents or health professionals to act as a donor. This paper adds to what is known about this topic by presenting the views of health professionals. METHODS: This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews with 14 health professionals in Australasia experienced in dealing with paediatric donors. Transcripts were analysed using established qualitative methodologies. RESULTS: Health professionals considered that some paediatric donors experience pressure to donate. Situations that were likely to increase the risk of pressure being placed on donors were identified, and views were expressed about the ethical 'appropriateness' of these practices within the family setting. CONCLUSIONS: Children may be subject to pressure from family and health professionals to be tested and act as donors, Therefore, our ethical obligation to these children extends to implementing donor-focused processes - including independent health professionals and the appointment of a donor advocate - to assist in detecting and addressing instances of inappropriate pressure being placed on a child.;;Then SN;;eng;['Australasia', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/ethics/*psychology', 'Child', '*Decision Making', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Pediatrics', 'Qualitative Research', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];['bone marrow transplantation', 'ethics', 'paediatrics', 'qualitative research', 'sibling'];;;10.1111/jpc.12934

High-risk kidney APOL1 variants have been associated with end-stage renal disease of multiple causes among African Americans, though the predictive power of these variants in population-based studies is small. No studies have looked at the effect of high-risk APOL1 alleles on donor outcomes, though few transplantation centers in the United States offer screening for APOL1 among African American donors. Screening all African Americans for high-risk APOL1 alleles may result in the exclusion of many potential donors ( approximately 13%  of African Americans). Such an exclusion may have a large effect on the availability of transplants for African Americans, who are already less likely to undergo transplantation.

958;26036527;Article;2015;Transplantation proceedings;;Quality and Quantity of Health Evaluation and the Follow-up of Iranian Living Donors.;;BACKGROUND: Shortage of donors is the main obstacle in organ transplantation. In  renal transplantation living donation is the key solution for removing this barrier. The Iranian model of kidney transplantation has been faced with many challenges, but there are limited reports about the depth of evaluation and outcome of donors. This study was conducted to assess the quality and quantity of donors' health evaluation before donation and their follow-up afterward. METHODS: With assistance of the Iranian Kidney Foundation, we accessed the contact information of living donors through the years 2001-2012. We tried to contact donors who have donated at least 2 years before the survey. We interviewed these  donors according to a questionnaire that was approved by the ethics committee of  the research deputy of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The collected data  were analyzed using the SPSS software version 20. RESULTS: The contact data of 388 donors were available but we were able to contact only 60 donors. We found that 40% of donors had been informed about the risks and benefits of donation. Also, 11% of donors had not had a full physical examination and in 5% even blood  pressure was not measured before donation by the transplantation team. The donors reported that 34% of them had not been educated on how they should follow up their health status and 50% of the donors did not have any follow-up after donation. CONCLUSION: In the Iranian model of transplantation the donors are the  neglected victims of renal transplantation and this model should be revised immediately, concerning both the medical and ethical issues.;;Khatami MR, Nikravan N, Alimohammadi F;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Kidney Transplantation/*standards', 'Living Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.11.059

We sought to determine theological perspectives and behaviors of clergy and theology students toward organ donation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of observational studies. RESULTS: There were 2154 participants. Eighty-two percent stated Islam allows organ donation. Nineteen had organ donation card (<1%). Fifty-four percent were reluctant to donate organs themselves, 56% lacked sufficient knowledge. Twenty percent referred to school education and periodicals as the source of information. Sixty-nine percent were act as opinion leaders for organ donation. In curriculums of the Faculties of Theology, organ donation as a separate topic has not been found. No articles regarding organ donation have been published in theology journals in their 60-year publication history. CONCLUSIONS: A discrepancy exists between the resolutions of the Board of Religious Affairs and  attitudes of clergy toward organ donation in Turkey. Theology faculties seem not  to pay specific attention to this issue. The Directorate of Religious Affairs and the faculty of theology should meet at a common point immediately in terms of training programs and continuing education with strict audit in context of organ  transplantation and donation.;;Aykas A, Uslu A, Dogan SM;;eng;['*Attitude', 'Clergy/*ethics', '*Curriculum', 'Humans', '*Intelligence', '*Islam', 'Male', 'Theology/*education', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Turkey'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.09.183

Educating through the doubt.;;"BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation in Brazil is increasing, but one of its current obstacles is the negative response of the population to organ donation. Therefore, to make the process viable, it is essential that people are educated in organ donation and transplantation. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the main doubts on this subject and to clarify these issues by educating the respondents on the basis of their questions. METHODS: Handout questionnaires  about organ donation and transplantation were distributed in public schools. The  public targets were parents, teachers, and students. The interviewers were trained medical students. RESULTS: In this pilot study with 293 subjects, 97% of  respondents had already heard about organ donation; 81% said they would donate their organs, whereas 76% said they would donate the organs of family members and 78% said they believe in the existence of organ trafficking in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of respondents believing in the existence of an  organ trade highlights the urgency in clarifying this topic. To do so, the population must be educated about the ethics of the process of donation, emphasizing the fact that there is no organ trade in Brazil.";;Mazzia AF, Hoppen CM, Isquierdo LD, Bourlegat ML, Picasso MC, Kissmann N, Gallo RB, Junior SP, Guimaraes VB, Garcia CD, Castro ED, Garcia VD;;eng;['Brazil', 'Education, Medical/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation/*education', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Pilot Projects', '*Students, Medical', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2015.03.018
961;26030521;Article;2015;JAMA internal medicine;;Crisis Awaiting Heart Transplantation: Sinking the Lifeboat.;;The number of heart transplants performed in the United States was 2177 in 1994 and 2166 in 2014. However, the number of transplant centers has increased, and the criteria for transplants have broadened to include patients 65 years or older, those with a body mass index greater than 30, and more comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and a history of smoking. As the transplant waiting list has become longer and waiting times have increased, the major route  to heart transplants has become deterioration to the most urgent priority status, which accounts for 10% of patients on the waiting list but two-thirds of transplants. Many heart transplant candidates develop life-threatening complications of a ventricular assist device implanted to avert death while waiting. Some affluent patients, however, can afford to temporarily relocate and  obtain a transplant in regions where the waiting times are shorter without prior  surgery to implant a ventricular assist device. The ethics of allocating hearts for transplant have always recalled the classic lifeboat dilemma of how many people can be allowed to board an already overcrowded lifeboat without sinking the ship and everyone on board. As transplant physicians, we advocate with the best intentions on behalf of our own patients rather than denying transplants to  those less likely to benefit. In recognizing our responsibilities as stewards of  scarce donor hearts, we should reduce new listings for heart transplants, thus restoring balance to the waiting list and keeping the lifeboat afloat.;;Stevenson LW;;eng;['Heart Failure/*therapy', '*Heart Transplantation', '*Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Triage', 'United States', '*Waiting Lists'];;;234-2005-37011C/PHS HHS/United States;10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.2203

The formation of chains for KPD and the shipping of kidneys have permitted networks such as the National Kidney Registry  (NKR) to offer KPD to patients over a transcontinental area. However, over the last 3 years, we have encountered patient requests for a more flexible experience in KPD to meet their individual needs often due to rigid time constraints. To accommodate these requests, we have developed an Advanced Donation Program (ADP)  in which the donor desires to donate by a specific date, but their paired recipient has not yet been matched to a specific donor or scheduled for surgery.  After obtaining careful informed consent from both the donor and paired recipient, 10 KPD chains were constructed using an ADP donor. These 10 ADP donors have facilitated 47 transplants, and thus far eight of their paired recipients have received a kidney within a mean of 178 (range 10-562) days. The ADP is a viable method to support time limited donors in a KPD network.;;Flechner SM, Leeser D, Pelletier R, Morgievich M, Miller K, Thompson L, McGuire S, Sinacore J, Hil G;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Directed Tissue Donation', 'Donor Selection/methods/organization & administration', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/methods/*organization & administration'];['donors and donation: living, ethics', 'donors and donation: paired', 'exchange', 'kidney transplantation: living donor'];;;10.1111/ajt.13339

Ensuring live donors' autonomy through informed consent is critical. We assessed live liver donors' (LD) comprehension, information needs, risk perceptions, and demographics. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were prospectively conducted with LDs after completing donor evaluation and informed consent at our transplant center. Likert scales measured informed consent domains. Open-ended responses underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty LDs participated (100% participation rate). Although 90% of LDs reported being informed about donation 'a great deal', only 66% reported understanding information about donation 'a great deal.' Many (40%) reported difficulty understanding medical terminology. Information LDs most desired to feel comfortable with their decision included: incidence and type of donor complications (67%), description of donation procedure (57%), and the process of donor preparation (43%). Most (83%) LDs rated risks to themselves as 'not at all' to 'somewhat' risky, and minimized these risks. CONCLUSIONS: Although LDs perceived that they were adequately informed, their actual comprehension about donation was inadequate. Findings suggest the value of informed consent for preparation for the procedure and potential periprocedural risks rather than for decision-making.

967;26002937;Article;2016;Nursing ethics;;Transplant tourism and organ trafficking: Ethical implications for the nursing profession.;;Organ availability for transplantation has become an increasingly complex and difficult question in health economics and ethical practice. Advances in technology have seen prolonged life expectancy, and the global push for organs creates an ever-expanding gap between supply and demand, and a significant cost in bridging that gap. This article will examine the ethical implications for the  nursing profession in regard to the procurement of organs from an impoverished seller's market, also known as 'Transplant Tourism'. This ethical dilemma concerns itself with resource allocation, informed consent and the concepts of egalitarianism and libertarianism. Transplant Tourism is an unacceptable trespass against human dignity and rights from both a nursing and collective viewpoint. Currently, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Royal college of Nursing Australia, The Royal College of Nursing (UK) and the American Nurses Association do not have position statements on transplant tourism, and this diminishes us as a force for change. It diminishes our role as advocates for the  most marginalised in our world to have access to care and to choice and excludes  us from a very contemporary real debate about the mismatch of organ demand and supply in our own communities. As a profession, we must have a voice in health policy and human rights, and according to our Code of Ethics in Australia and around the world, act to promote and protect the fundamental human right to healthcare and dignity.;;Corfee FA;;eng;['Australia', 'Codes of Ethics', '*Ethics, Nursing', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Medical Tourism/*ethics', 'Organ Trafficking/*ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/economics/ethics/nursing', 'Tissue Donors/ethics'];['Code of ethics', 'nursing ethics', 'organ trafficking', 'resource allocation', 'transplant tourism'];;;10.1177/0969733015581537

Creating a registry and mining the information it contains is, in my view, our moral and professional responsibility to future patients and the transplantation endeavor.

978;25908793;Article;2015;Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN;;Focus group study of public opinion about paying living kidney donors in Australia.;;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The unmet demand for kidney transplantation has generated intense controversy about introducing incentives for living kidney donors to increase donation rates. Such debates may affect public perception and  acceptance of living kidney donation. This study aims to describe the range and depth of public opinion on financial reimbursement, compensation, and incentives  for living kidney donors. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Twelve focus groups were conducted with 113 participants recruited from the general public in three Australian states in February 2013. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: creating ethical impasses (commodification of the body, quandary of kidney valuation, pushing moral boundaries), corrupting motivations (exposing the vulnerable, inevitable abuse, supplanting altruism), determining justifiable risk (compromising kidney quality, undue harm, accepting a confined risk, trusting protective mechanisms, right to autonomy), driving access (urgency of organ shortage, minimizing disadvantage, guaranteeing cost-efficiency, providing impetus, counteracting black markets), and honoring donor deservingness (fairness and reason, reassurance and rewards, merited recompense). Reimbursement and justifiable recompense are considered by the Australian public as a legitimate way of supporting donors and reducing disadvantage. Financial payment beyond reimbursement is regarded as morally reprehensible, with the potential for exploitative commercialism. Some contend that regulated compensation could be a defensible strategy to increased donation rates provided that mechanisms are in place to protect donors. CONCLUSIONS: The perceived threat to community values of human dignity, goodwill, and fairness suggests that there could be strong public  resistance to any form of financial inducements for living kidney donors. Policy  priorities addressing the removal of disincentives may be more acceptable to the  public.;;Tong A, Ralph AF, Chapman JR, Wong G, Gill JS, Josephson MA, Craig JC;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia', '*Compensation and Redress/ethics', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Crime/economics', 'Emotions', 'Female', '*Focus Groups', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Disparities/economics', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health, Reimbursement/*economics/ethics', 'Kidney Transplantation/*economics/ethics/methods/psychology', '*Living Donors/ethics/psychology/supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Perception', '*Public Opinion', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult'];['kidney donation', 'kidney transplantation', 'quality of life'];;;10.2215/CJN.10821014

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After ethics committee approval was obtained,  we retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplant from January 2000 to December 2013. A total 389 orthotopic liver transplants were performed in our center, but patients aged < 15 years (179 patients) were not included in the analyses. Patients were divided into 2 groups  based on their maximum intraoperative blood glucose level: group 1 (patients with intraoperative blood glucose level < 200 mg/dL) and group 2 (patients with intraoperative blood glucose level > 200 mg/dL). Postoperative complications between the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS: There were 58 patients (37.6%; group 1, blood glucose < 200 mg/dL) who had controlled blood glucose and 96 patients (62.3%; group 2, blood glucose > 200 mg/dL) who had uncontrolled blood glucose.

The article identified logistical and ethical issues  related to introduction of lung transplant from uDCDDs. In an open clinical trial, we have Food and Drug Administration and Institutional Review Board approval to transplant lungs recovered from uDCDDs judged suitable after EVLP. Through this project and other experiences with lung recovery from uDCDDs, we have identified solutions to many logistical challenges and have addressed ethical issues surrounding lung transplant from uDCDDs that were mentioned in this case report. Here, we discuss those challenges, including issues related to  recovery of other solid organs from uDCDDs. Despite logistical challenges, uDCDDs could solve the critical shortage of lungs for transplant. Furthermore, by avoiding the deleterious impact of brain death and days of positive pressure ventilation, and by using opportunities to treat lungs in the decedent or during  EVLP, lungs recovered from uDCDDs may ultimately prove to be better than lungs currently being transplanted from conventional brain-dead organ donors.;;Egan TM, Requard JJ 3rd;;eng;['*Cause of Death', 'Humans', '*Lung Transplantation', '*Shock', 'Spain', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['Clinical trial', 'donation after circulatory death (DCD)', 'donors and donation', 'dysfunction', 'editorial', 'ethics', 'ethics and public policy', 'lung (allograft) function', 'lung transplantation', 'organ perfusion and preservation', 'organ procurement and allocation', 'organ transplantation in general', 'personal viewpoint', 'pulmonology'];;1R38OT03593/OT/OSTLTS CDC HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.13246

However, due to the tension between their  rights and obligations, a lack of understanding and knowledge exists on how to prevent and report purchase. We present the results of a national survey that describes transplant professionals' experiences, attitudes, behaviors, conflicts  of duties, legal knowledge and needs for guidelines toward patients who purchase  kidneys abroad. Second, we clarify professionals' rights and obligations regarding organ purchase and propose actions that they can take to report purchase. Of the 100/241 (42%) professionals who treated patients who traveled to a country outside the European Union for a kidney transplant, 31 (31%) were certain that patients purchased kidneys. Sixty-five (65%) had suspicions that patients had bought kidneys. The majority reported a conflict of duties. Eighty percent reported a need for guidelines. Professionals can help prevent organ purchase by disclosing information about organ trafficking networks to law enforcement. Such disclosure can support the investigation and prosecution of networks. We offer key components for guidelines on disclosure of these networks.;;Ambagtsheer F, Van Balen LJ, Duijst-Heesters WL, Massey EK, Weimar W;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', '*Confidentiality', 'Continuity of Patient Care/standards', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organ Trafficking', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/standards'];['Donors and donation', 'ethics', 'ethics and public policy kidney transplantation', 'kidney transplantation: living donor', 'nephrology', 'organ sale', 'trade'];;;10.1111/ajt.13245

There is an overall organ shortage that affects all transplant candidates, including those with HIV. The use of HIV-infected donors could help alleviate this shortage. The precedent for  this approach was set in South Africa, where promising short-term outcomes have been reported in a limited number of HIV-infected recipients of kidney transplants from HIV-infected donors. As a consequence, the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act was passed in the United States, legalizing research into HIV-infected organ donation. In this review, we discuss some of the key issues related to HIV-infected organ donation, including the need for transplant in HIV-infected populations, characterization of the potential donor pool in the USA, criteria for donor selection, concerns specific to the HIV-infected donor, the ethics of HIV-infected organ donation, and the next steps toward making HIV-infected donation a reality in the USA.;;Richterman A, Blumberg E;;eng;;;;;10.1007/s11908-015-0471-z
984;25868787;Article;2015;American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons;;Development of a Donor-Centered Approach to Risk Assessment: Rebalancing Nonmaleficence and Autonomy.;;Living kidney donors are often excluded from the shared decision making and patient-centered models that are advocated in medical practice. Thresholds for acceptable risk vary between transplant centers, and between clinicians and donors. Although donor selection committees commonly focus on medical risks, potential donors also consider nonmedical risks and burdens, which may alter their assessment of an acceptable level of medical risk. Thus, transplant centers may encounter ethical tensions between nonmaleficence and respect for donor autonomy. A donor-centered model of risk assessment and risk reconciliation would integrate the donor's values and preferences in a shared decision about their eligibility to donate. This paper argues for shifting to a donor-centered model of risk assessment, and presents a research agenda to facilitate the greater participation of donors in their own evaluation and approval processes.;;Thiessen C, Gordon EJ, Reese PP, Kulkarni S;;eng;['*Decision Making', 'Donor Selection', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Patient Selection', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Risk Assessment/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Donors and donation: donor evaluation', 'donors and donation: living', 'editorial/personal viewpoint', 'ethics', 'ethics and public policy', 'kidney transplantation/nephrology', 'kidney transplantation: living donor', 'risk assessment/risk stratification'];;;10.1111/ajt.13272

However, the only countries to have approved a law allowing financial incentives  for organ donation are Iran in 1988 and, in some way and much later, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. In Europe financial incentives for donors are prohibited, except maybe in Austria. In Germany, it is forbidden to purchase organs not only  in the home country, but all over the world. The author was involved, as peer reviewer of a major international Transplant journal, in the evaluation of some papers concerning paid kidney living donors in Iran, and therefore made an extensive literature search on this topic and more generally on paid kidney living donation all over the world.

The gap between offer and demand grows wider every year and causes many patients in waiting list to die. In Spain, 90% of transplants are done with organs taken from patients deceased in brain death but this has a limited potential. In order to diminish organ shortage, alternative strategies such as donations from living donors, expanded criteria donors or donation after circulatory death, have been developed. Nevertheless, these types of donors also have their limitations and so are not able to satisfy current organ demand. It is necessary to reduce family denial and to raise donation in brain death thus generalizing, among other strategies, non-therapeutic elective ventilation. As intensive care doctors, cornerstone to the national donation programme, we must consolidate our commitment with society and organ transplantation.

The greatest potential source of kidneys is from living donors. Proposals to offer financial incentives to increase living kidney donation rates remain highly controversial. Despite repeated calls for a pilot study to assess the impact of financial compensation on living kidney donation rates, many fear that  financial incentives will exploit vulnerable individuals and cast the field of transplantation in a negative public light, ultimately reducing donation rates.

We believe it important not to conflate the illegal market for organs,  which we reject in the strongest possible terms, with the potential in the United States for concerted action to remove all remaining financial disincentives for donors and critically consider testing the impact and acceptability of incentives to increase organ availability in the United States.

To remedy this problem, a number of prominent physicians, ethicists, economists and others have mounted a campaign to suspend the prohibitions in the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) on the buying and selling of organs. The argument that providing financial benefits would incentivize enough people to part with a kidney (or a portion of a liver) to clear the waiting lists is flawed. This commentary marshals arguments against the claim that the shortage of donor organs would best be overcome by providing financial incentives for donation. We can increase the number of organs available for transplantation by removing all financial disincentives that deter unpaid living or deceased kidney donation. These disincentives include a range of burdens, such as the costs of travel and lodging for medical evaluation and surgery, lost wages, and the expense of dependent care during the period of organ removal and recuperation. Organ donation should remain an act that is financially neutral for donors, neither imposing financial burdens nor enriching them monetarily.;;Delmonico FL, Martin D, Dominguez-Gil B, Muller E, Jha V, Levin A, Danovitch GM, Capron AM;;eng;['Ethics, Medical', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/economics', '*Living Donors', 'Motivation', 'Nephrectomy/economics', 'Research Design', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/economics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics', 'United States', 'Waiting Lists'];['donors and donation: incentives', 'ethics', 'ethics and public policy', 'law / legislation'];;;10.1111/ajt.13232

The extent to which racial disparities in waitlisting differ between United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regions is understudied. METHODS: The US Renal Data System (USRDS) was linked with US census data to examine time from dialysis initiation to waitlisting for whites (n = 188,410) and African Americans (n = 144,335) using Cox proportional hazards across 11 UNOS regions, adjusting for potentially confounding individual, neighborhood, and state characteristics. RESULTS: Likelihood of waitlisting varies significantly by UNOS region, overall and by race. Additionally, African Americans face significantly lower likelihood of waitlisting compared to whites in all but two regions (1 and 6). Overall, 39% of African Americans with ESRD reside in Regions 3 and 4--regions with a large racial disparity and where African Americans comprise a large proportion of the ESRD population. In these regions, the African American-white disparity is an important contributor to their overall regional disparity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local ethics committee approved this study. Seventy-six recipients of double  lung allografts who underwent MR imaging of the lungs during an outpatient visit  between 2011 and 2013 were included in this study after they provided written informed consent. Patients were classified as having CLAD on the basis of spirometric results and were divided into three groups: no CLAD (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome level 0 [BOS 0]), early CLAD (BOS 0p), and late-stage CLAD (BOS 1-3). Coronal T1 maps of the lungs were acquired with the patient breathing  room air and 100% oxygen by using an inversion-recovery snapshot fast low-angle shot sequence at 1.5 T. The median and interquartile range of T1 values at room air and at 100% oxygen and the oxygen transfer function were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance and the Tukey honestly significant difference test or the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test (alpha = 0.05). Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The oxygen transfer function was significantly lower in patients in the BOS 0p (P = .025) and BOS 1-3 groups (P = .003) than it  was in the patients with BOS 0. Absolute T1 values (room air, P = .66; 100% oxygen, P = .67) did not differ significantly among the groups. The heterogeneity of T1 values, measured by using the interquartile range, showed a strong trend toward higher values in patients with BOS (room air, P = .06; 100% oxygen, P = .08).

A study protocol for a  randomised controlled trial.;;"INTRODUCTION: Liver disease mortality and morbidity are rapidly rising and liver  transplantation is limited by organ availability. Small scale human studies have  shown that stem cell therapy is safe and feasible and has suggested clinical benefit. No published studies have yet examined the effect of stem cell therapy in a randomised controlled trial and evaluated the effect of repeated therapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patients with liver cirrhosis will be randomised to one of  three trial groups: group 1: Control group, Standard conservative management; group 2 treatment: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; lenograstim) 15  microg/kg body weight daily on days 1-5; group 3 treatment: G-CSF 15 microg/kg body weight daily on days 1-5 followed by leukapheresis, isolation and aliquoting of CD133+ cells. Patients will receive an infusion of freshly isolated CD133+ cells immediately and frozen doses at days 30 and 60 via peripheral vein (0.2x10(6) cells/kg for each of the three doses). Primary objective is to demonstrate an improvement in the severity of liver disease over 3 months using either G-CSF alone or G-CSF followed by repeated infusions of haematopoietic stem cells compared with standard conservative management. The trial is powered to answer two hypotheses of each treatment compared to control but not powered to detect smaller expected differences between the two treatment groups. As such, the overall alpha=0.05 for the trial is split equally between the two hypotheses. Conventionally, to detect a relevant standardised effect size of 0.8 point reduction in Model for End-stage Liver Disease score using two-sided alpha=0.05(overall alpha=0.1 split equally between the two hypotheses) and 80% power requires 27 participants to be randomised per group (81 participants in total).

Recent developments with CPP (modeling studies and  small clinical experiences), have demonstrated substantial potential for increasing KE volumes. This encouraged us to reconsider initial ethical concerns, with a focus on the potential for a design of a prospective CPP clinical trial. This ethical reconsideration led us to conclude that the concept of unbalanced kidney exchanges (manifested primarily by differential benefit between compatible and incompatible pairs) is no longer as clear cut as originally conceived. In addition, application of two concepts substantially diminishes ethical concerns including: (1) ""quasi-compatible"" pairs, and (2) a priori definition of mitigating factors.

1005;25742424;Article;2015;Transplantation;;Perspectives of Transplant Professionals on the Values, Ethics, and Challenges of Living Kidney Donor Evaluation in Asia.;;BACKGROUND: Deceased donor rates in Asia are among the lowest in the world. This  has necessitated a reliance on living kidney donation, which has given rise to concerns about donor motivation and assessment in this region. We aimed to describe transplant professional perspectives on living kidney donor evaluation in Asia. METHODS: Face-to-face, semistructured interviews were conducted with 53  transplant professionals (nephrologists [n = 21], surgeons/urologists [n = 17], coordinators [n = 7], social workers [n = 5], ethicists [n = 2], psychologist [n  = 1]) from 20 centers in 10 countries. Transcripts were analyzed thematically to  identify themes. RESULTS: The theme of traversing vulnerability overarched 4 themes. Vigilance against exploitation of the vulnerable meant mitigating the threat of commercial transplantation, combating disparities, and verifying volunteerism. Maintaining clarity of professional roles encompassed the perceived necessity of legal safeguards to determine legitimacy of relationships, ensuring  informed consent, demarcating responsibilities, minimizing conflict of interest,  meeting community expectations, and resolving ambivalence regarding donor risk. Societal plight driving caution about living kidney donor assessment was emphasized in the context of poverty and desperation, higher risk of disease, and lack of social security. Navigating sociocultural barriers acknowledged the centrality of the family, economic priorities, distrust in modern medicine, generational traditions, and emotional opacity limiting their ability to gauge donor motivation. CONCLUSIONS: Moral, professional, sociocultural and societal vulnerabilities contribute to the barriers and ethical quandaries in living kidney donation in Asia. Strategies are needed to address culturally based anxieties and disparities in living donation. Transplant professionals depend on  strong legislation and policies to prevent exploitation of living donors.;;Tong A, Chapman JR, Kee T, Li PK, Tsai DF, Wong G, Craig JC;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Asia', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Cultural Characteristics', '*Donor Selection/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Interviews as Topic', '*Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology', '*Living Donors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology/supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Safety', 'Perception', 'Professional Role', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Responsibility', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Volition', 'Vulnerable Populations/psychology', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000000534

We evaluated the law's impact on the number and the socio-demographic features of 575 consecutive living donors, transplanted in the largest Israeli transplantation center, spanning 5 years prior to 5 years after the law's implementation. Living kidney donations increased from 3.5 +/- 1.5 donations per  month in the pre-law period to 6.1 +/- 2.4 per month post-law (p < 0.001). This was mainly due to a rise in intra-familial donations from 2.1 +/- 1.1 per month to 4.6 +/- 2.1 per month (p < 0.001). In unrelated donors we found a significant  change in their socio-demographic characteristics: mean age increased from 35.4 +/- 7.4 to 39.9 +/- 10.2 (p = 0.001), an increase in the proportion of donors with college level or higher education (31.0% to 63.1%; p < 0.001) and donors with white collar occupations (33.3% to 48.3%, p = 0.023).

1007;25728628;Article;2015;Sociology of health & illness;;Expanding the conceptual toolkit of organ gifting.;;In jurisdictions where the sale of body tissue and organs is illegal, organ transplantation is often spoken of as a gift of life. In the social sciences and  bioethics this concept has been subject to critique over the course of the last two decades for failing to reflect the complexities of organ and tissue exchange. I suggest that a new ethical model of organ donation and transplantation is needed to capture the range of experiences in this domain. The proposed model is  both analytical and empirically oriented, and draws on research findings linking  a series of qualitative sociological studies undertaken in New Zealand between 2007 and 2013. The studies were based on document analysis, field notes and 127 semi-structured in-depth interviews with people from different cultural and constituent groups directly involved in organ transfer processes. The aim of the  article is to contribute to sociological knowledge about organ exchange and to expand the conceptual toolkit of organ donation to include the unconditional gift, the gift relation, gift exchange, body project, and body work. The rationale for the proposed model is to provide an explanatory framework for organ donors and transplant recipients and to assist the development of ethical guidelines and health policy discourse.;;M Shaw R;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Communication', '*Gift Giving', 'Humans', 'Living Donors', 'Sociology, Medical', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];['altruism', 'bioethics', 'ethics', 'organ donation', 'qualitative methods'];;;10.1111/1467-9566.12258

However, xenotransplantation poses questions specifically concerning ethical and theological aspects that are imperative to address, such as personal identity between the poles of body, soul, and mind, the relationship between humans and animals, as well as challenges regarding specific issues of medical and social ethics. METHOD: This study summarizes the lectures of the symposium on ""Xenotransplantation-a challenge to theological ethics,"" which took place in Munich from September 30 until October 2, 2013, and analyses the implications of xenotransplantation from the perspectives of Christian theological ethics, biblical theology, and systematic theology. Furthermore, the issue of xenotransplantation is addressed from the perspectives of Judaism and Islam. Beyond these theological deliberations, the metaphorical and religious meaning of the human heart, which may have an impact on the societal acceptability of xenotransplantation, as well as the Christian notion of compassion regarding animals, is analyzed from the perspective of historical sciences.

A prospective study demonstrated that early liver transplantation in such patients  improved 2 year survival from 23% to 71% and only 3 of 26 patients returned to drinking after 1140 days; graft function was unaffected. Nonetheless, this treatment protocol may raise public concerns and affect organ donation rates. A total of 503 participants took a survey made available at an online crowdsourcing marketplace. The survey measured attitudes on liver transplantation generally and early transplantation for this patient population, in addition to measuring responses to nine vignettes describing fictional candidates. The majority of respondents (81.5%, n = 410) was at least neutral toward early transplantation for these patients; only a minority (26.3%) indicated that transplantation in any vignette would make them hesitant to donate their organs. Middle-aged patients with good social support and financial stability were viewed most favorably (p <  0.001). Age was considered the most important selection factor and financial stability the least important factor (each p < 0.001).

Documents of other Christian denominations will be discussed in a separate paper. Aspects concerning the areas of medicine, social ethics and animal ethics are considered as well as biographical, psychosocial, culture-bound and ideological preconditions of acceptability. These aspects also include consequences for the construction of personal identity.

Under Share 35, regional candidates with MELD >/= 35 receive higher priority than local candidates with MELD < 35. We compared liver distribution and mortality in  the first 12 months of Share 35 to an equivalent time period before. Under Share  35, new listings with MELD >/= 35 increased slightly from 752 (9.2% of listings)  to 820 (9.7%, p = 0.3), but the proportion of deceased-donor liver transplants (DDLTs) allocated to recipients with MELD >/= 35 increased from 23.1% to 30.1% (p < 0.001). The proportion of regional shares increased from 18.9% to 30.4% (p < 0.001).

Extensions and alternatives of liver transplantation have to  be regularly evaluated. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute-on-chronic liver failure and severe alcoholic hepatitis may represent potential extensions of transplant indications. In these diseases, selected patients could obtain a significant benefit from liver transplantation, whereas long-term outcomes and global impact  on waiting lists remain to be evaluated prospectively. Alternatives to transplantation may be represented by recent progress in the management of hepatitis C and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In hepatitis C, new drug combinations may improve the disease control, reducing the progression to cirrhosis and also the risk of post-transplant reinfection allowing to anticipate a future decrease in the indications for transplantation and retransplantation in these patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma, thanks to improvements in operative  techniques and better identification of prognostic factors of cancer recurrency,  surgical resection or radiofrequency destruction could appear now as true alternatives to transplant in highly selected patients. SUMMARY: Before implementation of these potential changes into decisional algorithms for listing  and organ allocation, their consequences, either for patient's individual benefit or for global transplant outcomes, should be closely evaluated using objective long-term end points and taking into account the ethical recommendations for organ transplantation.;;Lucidi V, Gustot T, Moreno C, Donckier V;;eng;['Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure/*surgery', 'Algorithms', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/therapy', 'Hepatitis, Alcoholic/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics/methods', 'Patient Selection/ethics', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1097/MCC.0000000000000186

Based on  interviews with registered donors and the intensive care unit staff responsible for managing organ donor patients we identify three types of valuation: the needs of recipients, respect for donors' autonomy and support of donors' relatives in their grieving process. Sometimes these modes of valuation conflict with each other, and we show how our informants then respond with a form of deliberate ignorance. We suggest that deliberate ignorance has a more general salience in the organ transplant field by way of facilitating a perception of organ transplantation as an abstract moral good rather than a specific good for specific people. Furthermore, we suggest that multiple forms of ignorance sustain each other: a desire for ignorance with respect to the prioritisation of recipients sustains pressure for more organs; this pressure necessitates more aggressive measures in organ procurement and these measures increase the need for ignorance in relation to the actual procedures as well as the actual recipients.  These attempts to avoid knowledge are in remarkable contrast to the otherwise widespread policy emphasis on education and information in this medical domain.";;Hoeyer K, Jensen AM, Olejaz M;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/organization & administration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Perception', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Young Adult'];['abstraction', 'anonymity', 'ignorance', 'information', 'organ donation', 'organ transplantation'];;;10.1111/1467-9566.12211

To date, the transplant community has not explicitly addressed the difficult question of how to make decisions when the differences are less dramatic. Existing well-accepted transplant policies neither articulate a criterion for where to draw the line nor provide an ethical justification for distinguishing those who should not be eligible for transplantation from those who should be. Herein we analyze a case from our LT program that raises the issue of how much of a difference should separate the eligible from the ineligible. We explain how our ethical analysis is consistent with the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients cumulative sum metric for transplant center performance, the United Network for Organ Sharing standard of capping Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores at 40 for listing purposes, and the longstanding tradition of allocating scarce medical resources in accordance with the principle of triage.

This was the beginning of major organ transplants commonly performed today, heralding one of the most significant achievements of medicine.  A half-century later, heart, liver, limb, and even face transplants have become standard practice. In this report, we explore details of the preparations, the ethical dilemmas and the unknowns, and how these issues were addressed and overcome. METHODS: Published works, hospital records, personal notes, and conversations with the individuals who participated in this event allowed us a unique opportunity to collect, analyze, and interpret the events. RESULTS: Several factors converged at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital to enable success. The department chair in medicine was committed to studying renal hypertension who then recruited others to work in this area. The department chair in surgery was committed to research, including making research results clinically useful. The chair of the anesthesia division was a technically skilled clinician, able to manage a previously unknown procedure. Finally, a suitable candidate for kidney transplant happened to have an identical twin brother, eliminating the issue of possible rejection. These factors aligned at the right time and place to transplant the first human kidney. CONCLUSIONS: Medical and ethical challenges dominated the scene of the first successful major organ transplant, which began the remarkable advance in transplant medicine, an advance that occurred very rapidly between 1947 and 1951.;;Leeson S, Desai SP;;eng;['Anesthesia', 'Boston', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/*history', 'Massachusetts', 'Postoperative Period'];;;;10.1213/ANE.0000000000000521

The OPTN/UNOS Board initiated a reassessment of the current allocation system. This paper describes the efforts of the OPTN/UNOS Heart Subcommittee, acting on behalf of the OPTN/UNOS Thoracic Organ Transplantation Committee, to modify the current allocation system. The Subcommittee assessed the limitations of the current three-tiered system, outcomes of patients with status  exceptions, emerging ventricular assist device (VAD) population, options for improved geographic sharing and status of potentially disenfranchised groups. They analyzed waiting list and posttransplant mortality rates of a contemporary cohort of patient groups at risk, in collaboration with the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to develop a proposed multi-tiered allocation scheme. This proposal provides a framework for simulation modeling to project whether candidates would have better waitlist survival in the revised allocation system,  and whether posttransplant survival would remain stable. The tiers are subject to change, based on further analysis by the Heart Subcommittee and will lead to the  development of a more effective and equitable heart allocation system.;;Meyer DM, Rogers JG, Edwards LB, Callahan ER, Webber SA, Johnson MR, Vega JD, Zucker MJ, Cleveland JC Jr;;eng;['Adult', 'Directed Tissue Donation', '*Health Care Rationing', 'Heart Diseases/*surgery', '*Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Resource Allocation', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States', 'Waiting Lists'];['United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)', 'ethics and public policy', 'heart transplantation/cardiology', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement and allocation'];;234-2005-37011C/PHS HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.13030

1034;25420927;Article;2016;Oral diseases;;Intraoral features and considerations in face transplantation.;;Face transplantation (FT) is a unique and novel addition to the field of reconstructive surgery, which offers new hope to facially disfigured individuals. This review provides an overview of FT, including clinical indications, immunological principles, and functional outcomes, as well as an in-depth characterization of the intraoral hard and soft tissue findings in the six patients transplanted to date at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA, USA. Six FT recipients underwent comprehensive clinical and radiographic evaluation to assess their intraoral status, function, and overall health. The extra- and intraoral soft tissue was assessed via quantitative sensory testing. The vitality of the transplanted dental hard tissue was evaluated with clinically available testing methods. Native teeth and prostheses were also assessed. Sensation of transplanted oral mucosa varied based on time elapsed from FT, ranging from minimal at 3 months post-FT, to nearly complete recovery by approximately 24 months. There was mixed success with the integration of donor teeth (Patients 1,  4 and 6), including associated occlusal discrepancies. Mucosal complications included constriction at the donor/recipient interface (Patients 2 and 5) and solitary episodes of mucosal rejection presenting as lichenoid inflammation (Patients 2 and 4). Face transplantation represents a pivotal moment in the history of reconstructive surgery and transplant medicine, providing new optimism to patients with gross facial deformities. This report highlights the successes of FT, but also the challenges of transplanting hard and soft tissues to restore  complex stomatognathic function. Further attention directed toward comprehensive  oral rehabilitation in FT will contribute to improved outcomes, with the ultimate goal of restoring and optimizing patient quality of life.;;Wall A, Bueno E, Pomahac B, Treister N;;eng;['Dental Occlusion', '*Facial Transplantation/ethics', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Humans', 'Mouth Mucosa/physiopathology/*transplantation', 'Patient Selection', 'Sensation', 'Tooth/*transplantation'];['face transplantation', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'lichenoid inflammation', 'transplant medicine'];;;10.1111/odi.12301

The aim of the present report is to give the rational and justification for this procedure. METHODS: All five donors  underwent the national standard living-donor screening procedure. Additionally, motivation to donate and psychologic stability were assessed by a psychologist using in-depth interview techniques and a psychologic complaints questionnaire. Post-donor nephrectomy follow-up consisted of standard questionnaires and clinical check-ups. RESULTS: One patient had cerebral and caudal ependymomas, one had severe and progressive emphysema, two had Huntington's disease and one had a  grade 2 oligodendroglioma. The psychologic screening revealed genuine motivation, adequate risk perception, and normal sense of reality. No contraindications for donation were found. The five donor nephrectomies made nine kidney transplantations possible. All donors were satisfied with the donation procedure. Three donors died during follow-up (0.6-4.9 years) as a result of their disease.  CONCLUSION: In the absence of apparent additional health risks, medical, and psychologic contraindications, we consider it ethically justified to accept an offer from a cognitively competent patient with a life-threatening disease in view of their self-reported satisfaction during follow-up. Although based on a limited number of patients, we conclude that a stricter psychologic screening for seriously ill donors compared to healthy unspecified anonymous donors to unspecified patients is not necessary.";;Rakke YS, Zuidema WC, Hilhorst MT, Erdman RA, Massey EK, Betjes MG, Dor FJ, IJzermans JN, Weimar W;;eng;['Altruism', 'Cause of Death', 'Cognition', '*Donor Selection/ethics', 'Female', 'Gift Giving', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*methods', 'Living Donors/ethics/psychology/*supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', '*Nephrectomy/adverse effects/ethics', 'Netherlands', 'Psychometrics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Volition'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000000281
1036;24370887;Article;2015;Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy;;Kidney sales and the analogy with dangerous employment.;;"Proponents of permitting living kidney sales often argue as follows. Many jobs involve significant risks; people are and should be free to take these risks in exchange for money; the risks involved in giving up a kidney are no greater than  the risks involved in acceptable hazardous jobs; so people should be free to give up a kidney for money, too. This paper examines this frequently invoked but rarely analysed analogy. Two objections are raised. First, it is far from clear that kidney sales and dangerous jobs involve comparable risks on an appropriately broad comparison. Second, and more importantly, even if they do involve comparable risks it does not follow that kidney sales must be permitted because dangerous jobs are. The analogy assumes that kidney sales are banned for paternalistic reasons. But there may be other, non-paternalistic reasons for the  ban. And paternalists, too, can consistently defend the ban even if kidney sales  are no riskier than occupations that they find acceptable. Soft paternalists may  want to protect would-be vendors from harms that they have not voluntarily chosen. Egalitarian hard paternalists may want to protect already badly off vendors from further worsening their situation. For neither species of paternalist is the size of the risk prevented decisive. I conclude that the analogy with dangerous jobs, while rhetorically powerful, pulls little real argumentative weight. Future debates on living kidney sales should therefore proceed without it.";;Malmqvist E;;eng;['Commerce/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', '*Employment', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Paternalism/ethics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/*ethics'];;;;10.1007/s10728-013-0270-3

1040;28031256;Article;2017;Journal of medical ethics;;Organ donation after medical assistance in dying or cessation of life-sustaining  treatment requested by conscious patients: the Canadian context.;;In June 2016, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada to decriminalise assistance in dying, the Canadian government enacted Bill C-14, legalising medical assistance in dying (MAID). In 2014, the province of Quebec had passed end-of-life care legislation making MAID available as of December 2015. The availability of MAID has many implications, including the possibility of combining this practice with organ donation through the controlled donation after cardiac death (cDCD) protocol. cDCD most often occurs in cases where the patient has a severe neurological injury but does not meet all the criteria for brain death. The donation is subsequent to the decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (LST). Cases where patients are conscious prior to the  withdrawal of LST are unusual, and have raised doubts as to the acceptability of  removing organs from individuals who are not neurologically impaired and who have voluntarily chosen to die. These cases can be compared with likely scenarios in which patients will request both MAID and organ donation. In both instances, patients will be conscious and competent. Organ donation in such contexts raises  ethical issues regarding respect for autonomy, societal pressure, conscientious objections and the dead-donor rule. In this article, we look at relevant policies in other countries and examine the ethical issues associated with cDCD in conscious patients who choose to die.;;Allard J, Fortin MC;;eng;['Brain Death', 'Canada', '*Consciousness', '*Death', '*Euthanasia, Active, Voluntary/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', '*Life Support Care', 'Mental Competency', 'Policy', '*Suicide, Assisted/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Terminal Care', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', '*Withholding Treatment'];['*Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues', '*Euthanasia', '*Suicide/Assisted Suicide', '*Vital organ donation'];Competing interests: M-CF is a member of the Transplant Quebec ethics committee.

This article, which is based on the reflections arising from the rich experience of Lyon's team in this field, addresses the topic of supporting the patient in his choice for or against this procedure. How should autonomy be understood in this particular setting? The developing field of composite tissue allotransplantation needs to establish a common thinking on this subject. The article emphasises that, even if it is their right to decide, patients have to be carefully supported to help them make the most consolidated choice possible in this challenging procedure. We deal with the question of the choice between the uncertainty in this innovative procedure and a life-threatening treatment to alleviate a handicap.

Conversely, millions of patients in the developing world with end-stage renal disease die because they cannot afford renal replacement therapy-even when  willing living kidney donors exist. This juxtaposition between countries with funds but no available kidneys and those with available kidneys but no funds prompts us to propose an exchange program using each nation's unique assets. Our  proposal leverages the cost savings achieved through earlier transplantation over dialysis to fund the cost of kidney exchange between developed-world patient-donor pairs with immunological barriers and developing-world patient-donor pairs with financial barriers. By making developed-world health care available to impoverished patients in the developing world, we replace unethical transplant tourism with global kidney exchange-a modality equally benefitting rich and poor. We report the 1-year experience of an initial Filipino pair, whose recipient was transplanted in the United states with an American donor's kidney at no cost to him. The Filipino donor donated to an American in the United States through a kidney exchange chain. Follow-up care and medications in the Philippines were supported by funds from the United States.

Wireless-enabled pill bottles have created the opportunity to monitor medication adherence in real time. Reminders may help  patients with poor memory or organization. Provision of adherence data to providers may motivate patients to improve adherence and help providers identify  adherence barriers. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Kidney transplant recipients (n=120) at a single center. INTERVENTION: Participants were provided wireless pill bottles to store tacrolimus and record bottle openings. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1  to adherence monitoring with customized reminders (including alarms, texts, telephone calls, and/or e-mails), monitoring with customized reminders plus provider notification (every 2 weeks, providers received notification if adherence decreased to <90% during that period), or wireless pill bottle use alone (control). OUTCOMES: The main outcome was bottle-measured tacrolimus adherence during the last 90 days of the 180-day trial. A secondary outcome was tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations at routine clinical visits. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence for the primary outcome was assessed via wireless pill bottle openings. RESULTS: Mean participant age was 50 years; 60% were men, and 40% were black. Mean adherence was 78%, 88%, and 55% in the reminders, reminders-plus-notification, and control arms (P<0.001 for comparison of each intervention to control). Mean tacrolimus levels were not significantly different between groups. LIMITATIONS: The study did not assess clinical end points. Participants and study coordinators were not blinded to intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: Provider notification and customized reminders appear promising in helping patients achieve better medication adherence, but these strategies require evaluation in trials powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.";;Reese PP, Bloom RD, Trofe-Clark J, Mussell A, Leidy D, Levsky S, Zhu J, Yang L, Wang W, Troxel A, Feldman HI, Volpp K;;eng;['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', '*Reminder Systems/statistics & numerical data', 'Tacrolimus/*therapeutic use'];['*Kidney transplantation', '*adherence', '*allograft loss', '*automated reminder', '*behavior change', '*compliance', '*end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', '*immunosuppression', '*kidney transplant recipient (KTR)', '*medication reminder', '*polypharmacy', '*randomized controlled trial', '*tacrolimus', '*tacrolimus trough level', '*wireless pill bottle'];;P30 AG034546/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;10.1053/j.ajkd.2016.10.017

Over the study  period, 565 pediatric patients with definite (131) or probable (434) ID received  first heart transplant, accounting for 22.4% of all first pediatric heart transplants (n=2524). Recipients with definite ID did not significantly differ from those without ID in terms of gender, ethnicity, ischemia time, severity of pretransplant condition (waitlist status, mechanical ventilation, inotrope dependence, ECMO, VAD, PVRI, infection prior to transplant), or incidents of acute rejection within the first year. ID was associated with prolonged waitlist  time (P<.001). Graft and patient survival at 3 years was equivalent between children with and without ID (P=.811 and .578, respectively). We conclude that intellectual disability is prevalent in children receiving heart transplants, with 22.4% of recipients over the study period having definite or probable ID. ID does not appear to negatively affect transplantation outcomes. Future studies are needed to assess long-term outcomes of transplantation in this population.;;Goel AN, Iyengar A, Schowengerdt K, Fiore AC, Huddleston CB;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology', 'Graft Survival', 'Heart Failure/complications/mortality/*surgery', 'Heart Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Disability/*complications', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome'];['cardiology', 'ethics', 'heart transplant', 'intellectual disability'];;;10.1111/petr.12858

B;;Prognostic significance of regulatory T lymphocytes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.;;We investigated the prognostic role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Relevant evidence regarding prognostic significance of Tregs was systematically searched in MEDLINE and Embase databases. A meta-analysis was performed to compare survival in patients with high or low Tregs level (either in peripheral blood or tumor). Eighteen studies were identified that fulfilled for the eligibility criteria and were included for data synthesis. Our pooled hazard ratios (HRs) demonstrated that increased Tregs  intratumoral accumulation was significantly associated with worse overall survival (HR=2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.72-2.42) and disease-free survival (HR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.58-2.09). Three studies evaluated the role of Tregs  in peripheral blood, and all of them showed that increased peripheral Tregs correlated with shortened disease-free and overall survival. Collectively, our results showed that the increased Tregs count is tightly associated with the shortened survivals. Its measurement in either primary tumor or even circulation  might be a candidate marker of prognostic significance in HCC patients.;;Zhang AB, Qian YG, Zheng SS;;eng;['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*immunology/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Publication Bias', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology'];['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Prognosis', 'Regulatory T cells'];Compliance with ethics guidelines: Ai-bin ZHANG, Yi-gang QIAN, and Shu-sen ZHENG  declare that they have no conflict of interest.

RESULTS: All surveyed hand therapists work with children (n  = 18 Australia [AU], n = 85 United States) and some had been involved in adult hand transplant rehabilitation (28% AU, 21% United States; P = .543, not significant (NS)). The US and AU therapists differ regarding their opinions on multidisciplinary team membership, smoking as an exclusion criterion, and risk of posttransplant rehabilitation noncompliance. DISCUSSION: This research opens a dialogue on the clinical and ethical complexity of PHT, including team configuration, inclusion/exclusion criteria, the assent process, and rehabilitation access/compliance.

Such artificial organs could make transplant waiting lists and immunosuppression a thing of the past. Supposing that this happens, what will the ongoing care of people with these implants involve? In particular, how will the need to maintain the functioning of artificial organs over an extended period affect patients and their doctors and the responsibilities of those who manufacture such devices? Drawing on lessons from the history of the cardiac pacemaker, this article offers an initial survey of the ethical issues posed by the need to maintain and service artificial organs. We briefly outline the nature and history of cardiac pacemakers, with a particular focus on the need for technical support, maintenance, and replacement  of these devices. Drawing on the existing medical literature and on our conversations and correspondence with cardiologists, regulators, and manufacturers, we describe five sources of ethical issues associated with pacemaker maintenance: the location of the devices inside the human body, such that maintenance generates surgical risks; the complexity of the devices, which increases the risk of harms to patients as well as introducing potential injustices in access to treatment; the role of software-particularly software that can be remotely accessed-in the functioning of the devices, which generates  privacy and security issues; the impact of continual development and improvement  of the device; and the influence of commercial interests in the context of a medical device market in which there are several competing products.

At that time, three social scientists-political scientist Richard Titmuss in the United Kingdom and sociologist Renee C. Fox working with historian Judith Swazey in the United States-had the idea of using this concept to highlight the fundamental structure of the biomedical practices they were studying, respectively, blood donation, and hemodialysis and organ transplantation. The fact that these first applications of Mauss's essay should emerge in English- rather than in French-speaking countries raises the question of what the translation of the essay, and notably of the word don as gift, may have to do with this fact. Reading Mauss in translation undoubtedly inspired a seminal approach to interpreting medical and research practices based on bodily giving. This article posits that something may have also been lost: a much broader concept of giving with unquestionable links to the Durkheimian concept of solidarity, which Mauss conceptualizes not only as an obligation but also as a liberty to give.;;Bateman S;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Biomedical Research/*ethics', 'Gift Giving', 'Humans', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Transplantation/ethics', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];['Biomedical practices', 'Gift relationship', 'Gift-exchange', 'Marcel Mauss', 'Moral sociology', 'Solidarity', 'Emile Durkheim'];;;10.1007/s11017-016-9384-6

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive literature survey was made, and expert opinions were obtained. RESULTS: The gap between demand and  supply of organs for transplant has yielded to organ trafficking, organ tourism,  and commercialism. This problem seems to be the most important issue, and naturally there are ethical dilemmas related to it. A wide number of ideas have been expressed on the subject, and different solutions have been proposed. CONCLUSION: The struggle against organ trafficking and commercialism should include legislation, efforts to increase deceased-donor donations, and international cooperation.

We sought to describe the prevalence and outcomes of heart transplantation in children with intellectual disability and hypothesized that recipients with intellectual disability have comparable short-term outcomes compared to recipients without intellectual disability. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of children receiving a first heart-alone transplant in the UNOS STAR database from 2008 to 2013. Recipients with intellectual disability were compared to those without using chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for patient and graft survival. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate  the association between intellectual disability and graft failure and patient survival. Over the study period, 107 children with intellectual disability underwent initial heart transplantation, accounting for 8.9% of first pediatric heart transplants (total=1204). There was no difference in the incidence of acute rejection between groups in the first year after transplant. Mean functional status scores at follow-up improved in both groups after transplantation, but tended to be lower among children with intellectual disability than children without. Log-rank tests did not suggest significant differences in graft survival between those with and without intellectual disability during the first 4 years following transplantation.

A related question is addressed in this paper: is controlled organ donation after assisted  death (cDAD) more or less ethically-problematic than standard, controlled organ donation after circulatory determination of death (cDCDD)? Controversial, ethics-related dimensions of cDCD that are of relevance to this research question are explored, and morally-relevant distinctions between cDAD and cDCD are identified. In addition, a set of morally-relevant advantages of one practice over the other is uncovered, and a few potential, theoretical issues specifically related to cDAD practice are articulated. Despite these concerns, the analysis suggests a counterintuitive conclusion: cDAD is, overall, less ethically-problematic than cDCDD. The former practice better respects the autonomy interests of the potential donor, and a claim regarding irreversibility  of cessation of the donor's circulatory function in the cDAD context can be supported. Further, with cDAD, there is no possibility that the donor will have negative sensory experiences during organ procurement surgery. Although the development of appropriate policy-decision and regulatory approaches in this domain will be complex and challenging, the comparative ethical analysis of these two organ donation practices has the potential to constructively inform the deliberations of relevant stakeholders, resource persons and decision makers.;;Kirby J;;eng;['Canada', 'Death', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Morals', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Suicide, Assisted/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Assisted death', 'Autonomy interests', 'Donation after circulatory death', 'Irreversibility', 'Morally-relevant advantages'];;;10.1007/s11019-016-9711-8

International awareness and condemnation contributed to the announcement abolishing the procurement of organs from executed prisoners starting from January 2015. Eighteen months after the announcement, and aligned with the upcoming International Congress of the Transplantation Society in Hong Kong, this paper revisits the topic and discusses whether the declared reform has indeed been implemented. China has neither addressed nor included in the reform a pledge to end the procurement of organs from prisoners of conscience, nor has the government initiated any legislative amendments. Recent reports have discussed an implausible discrepancy of officially reported steady annual transplant numbers and a steep expansion of the transplant infrastructure in China. This paper expresses the viewpoint that, in the current context, it is not possible to verify the veracity of the announced changes, and it thus remains premature to include China as an ethical partner in  the international transplant community.

Izmir Tepecik Training Research Hospital Organ Transplantation Center is still the only pediatric intestinal transplant center in Turkey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients' data were analyzed from the medical charts and the hospital digital database. Seven isolated SBTxs were performed in six children between 2010 and 2016. RESULTS: One jejunal segment and six partial jejuno-ileal segments were used for seven transplants. All grafts were retrieved from deceased donors (one child and six adult donors). The six recipients had a mean age of 8.8+/-6.9 years (9 months to  17 years; M: 4, F: 2). The mean follow-up period of patients was 727+/-848 (34 to 1950) days. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) rates were 57% (n: 4) in the first 2 months. Graft loss due to severe ACR was seen in one patient. Central line-associated fungal (n: 3, 42%) and bacterial infections (n: 3, 42%) were seen in the first 2 months. Two Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections were recorded between 3 and 8 months in two patients. Our 1-year patient and graft survival rates were 71% and 71%, respectively. CONCLUSION: SBTx has become a treatment modality for patients with intestinal failures. Management of ACR and infections  are still challenging problems in SBTx.

The risk of SCC was greater in the universal prophylaxis cohort (HR 2.02, P < 0.01). Voriconazole exposure was greater in the universal prophylaxis cohort, and the cumulative exposure to voriconazole was associated with SCC (HR 1.75, P < 0.01), even after adjustment for other important SCC risk  factors.

Pediatric kidneys constitute 10% to 12% of deceased donor kidneys. We hypothesized that KDPI would not accurately predict pediatric donor graft survival and superior predictive models could be created. METHODS: Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for years 2000 to 2010 for transplants from child (<10 years) and adolescent (10-17 years inclusive) donors into first-time adult recipients were analyzed with graft failure as the principle outcome. Two novel indices, Child Donor Index (CDI) and Adolescent Donor Index (ADI), were developed using stepwise variable deletion to identify significant model covariates in a Cox Regression. Pediatric donor kidneys were then classified into the 4 quality groups based on both KDPI and CDI/ADI scores. The performance of the KDPI, CDI, and ADI models were compared with respect to the 4  quality groups defined by the new allocation system. RESULTS: The KDPI did not effectively discriminate between quality groups (P > 0.05 for all but 1 comparison) in Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. The CDI and ADI included novel variables (eg, body mass index percentiles) and successfully discriminated between quality groups (P < 0.05 by log rank test). The Net Reclassification Index showed improvement when switching from KDPI to CDI and ADI, with values of  0.09 (P < 0.001) and 0.073 (P < 0.001), respectively.

1069;27767220;Article;2017;Bioethics;;Misplaced Paternalism and other Mistakes in the Debate over Kidney Sales.;;Erik Malmqvist defends the prohibition on kidney sales as a justifiable measure to protect individuals from harms they have not autonomously chosen. This appeal  to 'group soft paternalism' requires that three conditions be met. It must be shown that some vendors will be harmed, that some will be subject to undue pressure to vend, and that we cannot feasibly distinguish between the autonomous  and the non-autonomous. I argue that Malmqvist fails to demonstrate that any of these conditions are likely to obtain. His argument involves two common errors. First, he, like many, proceeds on a mistaken understanding of how to assess harm. What matters is not the balance of costs and benefits of vending, but a comparison of potential vendors' welfare across two possible courses of action. Second, Malmqvist's concerns about third-party pressure are predicated on an empirically unrealistic understanding of the operation of a regulated market. A widely underappreciated fact is that kidney sales will be relatively rare, and most who try to vend will be unable to. Because pressure on another to vend will  not result in the desired outcome, few will exert it.;;Semrau L;;eng;['*Commerce', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Male', 'Paternalism/*ethics', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['autonomy', 'harm', 'kidney markets', 'paternalism'];;;10.1111/bioe.12303
1070;27517164;Article;2016;Bioethics;;Why Alcoholics Ought to Compete Equally for Liver Transplants.;;Some philosophers and physicians have argued that alcoholic patients, who are responsible for their liver failure by virtue of alcoholism, ought to be given lower priority for a transplant when donated livers are being allocated to patients in need of a liver transplant. The primary argument for this proposal, known as the Responsibility Argument, is based on the more general idea that patients who require scarce medical resources should be given lower priority for  those resources when they are responsible for needing them and when they are competing with patients who need the same resources through no fault of their own. Since alcoholic patients are responsible for needing a new liver and are in  direct competition with other patients who need a new liver through no fault of their own, it follows that alcoholic patients ought to be given lower priority for a transplant. In this article, I argue against the Responsibility Argument by suggesting that in order for it to avoid the force of plausible counter examples, it must be revised to say that patients who are responsible for needing a scarce  medical resource due to engaging in behavior that is not socially valuable ought  to be given lower priority. I'll then argue that allocating organs according to social value is inconsistent or in tension with liberal neutrality on the good life.

In parallel, some countries have developed uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD)  programs using ECMO to preserve organs for transplantation purposes. AIM: When facing a refractory OHCA, how does the medical team choose between initiating ECMO as part of an E-CPR protocol or ECMO as part of a uDCDD protocol? METHODS: To answer these questions we conducted a literature review on E-CPR compared to uDCDD protocols using ECMO and analyzed the raised ethical issues. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals that the inclusion criteria in E-CPR and uDCDD protocols are similar. There may be a non-negligible risk of including patients in a uDCDD protocol, when the patient might have been saved by the use of E-CPR. CONCLUSION: In order to avoid the fatal error of letting a saveable patient die, safeguards are necessary. We recommend: (1) the development of internationally accepted termination of resuscitation guidelines that would have to be satisfied prior to  inclusion of patients in any uDCDD protocol, (2) the choice regarding modalities  of ongoing resuscitation during transfer should be focused on the primary priority of attempting to save the life of patients, (3) only centers of excellence in life-saving resuscitation should initiate or maintain uDCDD programs, (4) E-CPR should be clinically considered first before the initiation of any uDCDD protocol, and (5) there should be no discrimination in the availability of access to E-CPR.;;Dalle Ave AL, Shaw DM, Gardiner D;;eng;['Bioethical Issues', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*ethics', 'Decision Making', 'Emergency Medical Services/ethics', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/mortality/*therapy', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics'];['*Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)', '*Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)', '*Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (E-CPR)', '*Out-of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)', '*Uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD)'];;;10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.07.003

Our purpose was to evaluate patient's access to kidney transplantation in Portugal, regarding their degree of allosensitization and blood type. A retrospective cohort study including 1020 candidates for kidney transplantation between 01 January 2010 and 31 December 2011 in transplant unit Centro Hospitalar do Porto was performed. The deceased donor organ offer by blood type decreased with the calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) increase for A and B blood groups candidates, while in 0 blood group candidates, a significant reduction in organ offer was only observable in hypersensitized (HS) ones. As a consequence, the median waiting time was also significantly higher in 0 blood group patients, when compared to the remaining groups. However, waiting time increased extensively with cPRA regardless blood type, especially HS patients with increases of 368%, 632%, 486%, and 140% for blood groups A, B, AB, and 0, respectively, when compared to each blood group global median waiting time.

Provided that governments recognize that people have a right to determine what happens to their organs after they die, there are four feasible options to choose from: opt-in, opt-out, mandated active choice, and voluntary active choice. We investigate the ethics of these policies' use of nudges to affect organ donor registration rates. We argue that the use of nudges in this context is morally problematic. It is disrespectful of  people's autonomy to take advantage of their cognitive biases since doing so involves bypassing, not engaging, their rational capacities. We conclude that while mandated active choice policies are not problem free-they are coercive, after all-voluntary active choice, opt-in, and opt-out policies are potentially less respectful of people's autonomy since their use of nudges could significantly affect people's decision making.;;MacKay D, Robinson A;;eng;['*Choice Behavior', 'Coercion', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Registries', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['*end-of-life issues', '*health policy', '*organ transplantation', '*philosophy'];;;10.1080/15265161.2016.1222007

BACKGROUND: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding economic implications and may improve risk prediction. DESIGN: A nation-wide multi-centre  prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study. METHODS: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals' management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained in January 2016.

1081;27677977;Article;2016;Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany);;Quality of life in children with chronic kidney disease.;;BACKGROUND: Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), irrespective of the underlying etiology, affects the quality of life (QoL) of children due to the need for regular follow-up visits, a strict medication program and diet intake. METHODS: The Greek version of the KIDSCREEN-52 multidimensional questionnaire was used in children with CKD, renal transplantation (RT) and in a control group (CG) of healthy children. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients between 8 and 18 years, with CKD (n = 25), RT (n = 16) and with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (n = 14) were included. Each group of studied children was compared with the CG (n = 55), the validation sample (VS) (n = 1200) and the parent proxy  scores. Physical well-being of all studied children was significantly lower compared to CG (p = 0.004). In contrast, all studied children between 8 and 11 years showed better social acceptance compared to VS (p = 0.0001). When QoL of children with CKD was compared with parent proxy QoL, conflicting opinions were observed in several dimensions, such as self-perception (p = 0.023), autonomy (p  = 0.012), school environment (p = 0.012) and financial resources (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: QoL and mainly the dimension of physical well-being, may be affected dramatically in children with CKD unrelated to disease stage. In early school years children with CKD seem to feel higher social acceptance than the healthy controls, exhibiting better score in this dimension. Optimal care requires attention not only to medical management, but also to an assessment of QoL factors, that may help promote pediatric patient's health.;;Dotis J, Pavlaki A, Printza N, Stabouli S, Antoniou S, Gkogka C, Kontodimopoulos N, Papachristou F;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/psychology', 'Kidney Transplantation/psychology', 'Male', 'Personal Autonomy', '*Quality of Life', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Self Concept', 'Self Report', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys and Questionnaires'];['*Chronic kidney disease', '*Quality of life', '*Questionnaire', '*Renal transplantation'];;;10.1007/s00467-016-3457-7

Advancements in surgical techniques and donor-recipient  matching, however, have allowed expansion of SLT from utilization of the right trisegment graft to now include use of the hemiliver graft as well. Despite less  favorable outcomes in the early experience, better outcomes have been reported by experienced centers and have further validated the feasibility of SLT. Importantly, more than two decades of experience have identified key requirements for successful SLT in adults. When these requirements are met, SLT can achieve outcomes equivalent to those achieved with other types of liver transplantation for adults. However, substantial challenges, such as surgical techniques, logistics, and ethics, persist as ongoing barriers to further expansion of this highly complex procedure.

1083;27659295;Article;2016;Monash bioethics review;;"Iranian kidney market in limbo: a commentary on ""The ambiguous lessons of the Iranian model of paid living kidney donation"".";;Sigrid Fry-Revere's The Kidney Sellers: A Journey of Discovery in Iran, an allegedly first-hand examination of the Iranian paid kidney donation model, has been criticized by Koplin in an essay formerly published in the Monash Bioethics  Review. Koplin especially challenges Fry-Revere's claim that financially compensating kidney vendors might facilitate altruistic kidney donation. The current situation in Iran, according to Koplin, suggests that the market model has undermined altruistic donation. On this point, this commentary tries to show  that healthcare policymakers in Iran no longer see the Iranian paid kidney donation model as a sustainable and ethically justifiable status quo. Briefly touching on the criticisms that have been made even by some positive commentators of the Iranian model, this commentary aims to call attention to the fact that the current dynamic within healthcare policymaking in Iran seeks primarily to decrease its reliance on the organ market instead of revising and modifying it. This complicates the plausibility of any kind of extrapolation, replication or extracting empirical support from the Iranian model to create organ markets in other countries, for example, as Fry-Revere suggests to conduct a trial of a financially incentivized kidney donation scheme in the US. The conclusion is that the Iranian healthcare system should tackle the organ shortage through increasing altruistic living and postmortem kidney donations. This might also provide, finally, a space for conducting extensive and long-term follow-up studies on well-being, satisfaction and social integration of Iranian kidney vendors.;;Soofi H;;eng;['Commerce/*economics/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Kidney Transplantation/*economics/*ethics', 'Living Donors/ethics', 'Motivation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/*ethics'];['*Iran', '*Kidney donation', '*Medical ethics', '*Organ market', '*Organ transplantation'];;;10.1007/s40592-016-0065-z

1085;30135813;Article;2016;Internet interventions;;Google analytics of a pilot mass and social media campaign targeting Hispanics about living kidney donation.;;Background: The number of patients waiting for a kidney transplant surpasses available organs. Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) can expand the organ pool. However, Hispanics have lower rates of LDKT than non-Hispanic whites, largely due to a lack of awareness and knowledge about LDKT as a treatment option. To reduce this disparity about LDKT, Northwestern University faculty in partnership with the National Kidney Foundation of Illinois, developed a website  culturally targeted to Hispanics about LDKT, called Informate. Objective: This paper describes a pilot mass media campaign about LDKT which leveraged Informate  to provide additional education about LDKT targeting the Hispanic public in Chicago, IL. We report the impact of the campaign on visits to Informate. Methods: The mass media campaign was conducted in Chicago, IL from July 16, 2015  to January 17, 2016 in two waves. The campaign used traditional media, online media, and community-based venues. The campaign's bilingual (Spanish and English) messaging addressed key topics about kidney disease and LDKT, and included a call to action to visit Informate to learn more. Google Analytics was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign's call to action by measuring the number of visits to Informate, visit duration, bounce rate, number of pages visited, pages  most often visited, user demographics, and media channel. Results: Informate received an average of 1466 sessions per month during the entire campaign period, with a 16.7% return rate. Sessions and visitors increased during the entire campaign period compared to the pre- and post- campaign periods. Visits lasted an average of 1:26 min, with a bounce rate of 73.9% per session. Users visited an average of 1.93 pages, and the pages with the most views were Immigrant Issues and Financial Issues. Most sessions during this period occurred in the USA (69.57%) out of 100 countries, and in the city of Chicago (13.37%). Sessions were mostly conducted by men (54.1%) and people ages 18-34 (61%). Visitors accessed Informate primarily through their desktop computer (53.1%), and by typing the website address directly into their browser (32.78%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that our pilot mass media campaign's call to action was effective in increasing the Hispanic public's traffic to Informate. Google Analytics data can  help to strategize future campaign messages and outlets. Future research should assess whether a theoretically-driven mass media campaign increases the Hispanic  public's knowledge about LDKT, and increases rates of LDKT.;;Gordon EJ, Shand J, Black A;;eng;;['CTA, Chicago Transit Authority', 'Culturally sensitive', 'Disparities', 'ESRD, end-stage renal disease', 'Education', 'Ethics', 'Hispanic', 'Internet', 'Kidney transplantation', 'LDKT, living donor kidney transplantation', 'Latino', 'Living donation', 'NKFI, National Kidney Foundation of Illinois', 'PSA, public service announcement', 'Spanish', 'eHealth intervention'];;;10.1016/j.invent.2016.09.002

1087;27633468;Article;2016;Internal medicine journal;;Gene editing advance re-ignites debate on the merits and risks of animal to human transplantation.;;In Australia, and internationally, the shortage of organ and tissue donors significantly limits the number of patients with critical organ or tissue failure who are able to receive a transplant each year. The rationale for xenotransplantation - the transplantation of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another - is to meet this shortfall in human donor material. While early clinical trials showed promise, particularly in patients with type I diabetes whose insulin dependence could be temporarily reversed by the transplantation of porcine islet cells, these benefits have been balanced with scientific, clinical and ethical concerns revolving around the risks of immune rejection and the potential transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses or other infectious agents from porcine grafts to human recipients. However, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9, a revolutionary gene editing technology, has reignited interest in the field with the possibility of genetically engineering porcine organs and tissues that are less immunogenic and have virtually no risk of transmission of porcine endogenous retroviruses. At the same time, CRISPR/Cas9 may also open up a myriad of possibilities for tissue engineering and stem cell research, which may complement xenotransplantation research by providing an additional source of donor cells, tissues and organs for transplantation into patients. The recent international symposium on gene editing, organised by the US National Academy of Sciences, highlights both the enormous therapeutic potential  of CRISPR/Cas9 and the raft of ethical and regulatory challenges that may follow  its utilisation in transplantation and in medicine more generally.;;Fung RK, Kerridge IH;;eng;['Animals', 'Australia', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/surgery', 'Gene Editing/*ethics/methods', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation', 'Risk Assessment', 'Swine', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*ethics'];['emerging biotechnologies', 'gene editing', 'regenerative medicine', 'tissue engineering', 'xenotransplantation', 'xenozoonosis'];;;10.1111/imj.13183

1094;27598872;Article;2016;Deutsches Arzteblatt international;;Organ-Protective Intensive Care in Organ Donors.;;"BACKGROUND: The ascertainment of brain death (the irreversible, total loss of brain function) gives the physician the opportunity to limit or stop further treatment. Alternatively, if the brain-dead individual is an organ donor, the mode of treatment can be changed from patient-centered to donationcentered. Consensus-derived recommendations for the organ-protective treatment of brain-dead organ donors are not yet available in Germany. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, and on the authors' clinical experience. RESULTS: Brain death causes major pathophysiological changes, including an increase in catecholamine levels and a sudden drop in the concentration of multiple hormones, among them antidiuretic hormone, cortisol, insulin, and triand tetraiodothyronine. These changes affect the function of all organ systems, as well as the hemodynamic state and the regulation of body temperature. The use of standardized donor management protocols might well increase the rate of transplanted organs per donor and improve the quality of the transplanted organs. In addition, the administration of methylprednisolone, desmopressin, and vasopressin could be a useful supplement to treatment in some cases. Randomized controlled trials have not yet demonstrated either improved organ function or prolonged survival of the transplant recipients. CONCLUSION: The evidence base for organ-protective intensive care is weak; most of the available evidence is on the level of expert  opinion. There is good reason to believe, however, that the continuation of intensive care, in the sense of early donor management, can make organ transplantation more successful both by increasing the number of transplantable organs and by improving organ quality.";;Hahnenkamp K, Bohler K, Wolters H, Wiebe K, Schneider D, Schmidt HH;;eng;['Brain Death/*diagnosis', 'Critical Care/ethics/*standards', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Patient-Centered Care/*standards', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*standards'];;;;10.3238/arztebl.2016.0552

Examining withdrawal of clinically assisted nutrition and hydration in patients in the permanent vegetative state.;;In this paper, I explore under what circumstances it might be morally acceptable  to transplant organs from a patient lacking capacity. I argue, with a developed hypothetical based around a mother and son, that (1) 'Best interests' should be interpreted broadly to include the interests that people have previously expressed in the well-being of others. It could, therefore, be in the 'best interests' of an unconscious patient to donate a non-vital organ to a family member. (2) Further expanding upon this case, and developing a variation on the 'trolley problems' I argue that where it is inevitable that an incapacitous patient is going to die-and specifically when it has been agreed through the courts that a patient in a permanent vegetative state is going to have clinically assisted nutrition and hydration withdrawn (with the inevitable consequence of death, and causing desiccation of the organs such that they are no longer able to be donated)-it could be in a patient's best interests to actively end their life  with a drug that would stop the heart both to minimise potential suffering and in order to be able to have vital organs donated. I argue that in this case the strict adherence to the distinction between acts and omissions is not in the patient's best interests and should be reconsidered.;;Fritz Z;;eng;['*Consciousness', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'Dissent and Disputes', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Life Support Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Morals', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Persistent Vegetative State', '*Tissue Donors', 'Withholding Treatment/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];['*Attitudes Toward Death', '*Autonomy', '*Ethics', '*Legal Aspects', '*Right to Refuse Treatment'];;Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom;10.1136/medethics-2015-103045

However, controversies exist around cancer screening in this population owing to reduced life expectancy and competing causes of death. This systematic review assesses the availability, quality and consistency of cancer screening recommendations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). We systematically searched bibliographic databases and gray literature to identify CPGs and assessed their quality using AGREE II. Recommendations were extracted along with their supporting evidence. Thirteen guidelines were included in the review. CPGs for kidney recipients were the most frequent source of screening recommendations, and recommendations for skin cancer screening were most frequently presented. Some screening recommendations differed from those for the  general population, based on literature demonstrating higher cancer incidence among SOTRs versus direct evidence of screening effectiveness. Relevant stakeholders such as oncology specialists, primary care providers and public health experts were not involved in the formulation of the screening recommendations. In conclusion, although several guidelines make recommendations  for cancer screening in SOTRs, the availability of cancer screening recommendations varied considerably by transplanted organ. More studies are required to inform cancer screening recommendations in SOTRs, and guideline development should involve transplant patients, oncologists and cancer screening  specialists.;;Acuna SA, Huang JW, Scott AL, Micic S, Daly C, Brezden-Masley C, Kim SJ, Baxter NN;;eng;['Early Detection of Cancer', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology/prevention & control', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Prognosis', 'Transplant Recipients'];['*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia', '*clinical research/practice', '*complication: malignant', '*diagnostic techniques and imaging', '*ethics and public policy', '*guidelines', '*organ transplantation in general'];;115164/CIHR/Canada;10.1111/ajt.13978

No specific policies exist to suggest that exchange/chain donors and their recipients should be treated differently. We surveyed transplant professionals (surgeons and nephrologists) and members of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF)  to determine their support for disclosing to donors the health, health behavior,  and social information of their exchange/chain donors and exchange/chain recipients. METHODS: Twenty questions regarding disclosing to donors information  about both their exchange/chain donors and exchange/chain recipients were included in 2 larger surveys on disclosure about kidney transplantation. Survey A was sent electronically to NKF list-servs, and survey B was sent to transplant professionals both electronically and by postal mail. RESULTS: Survey A yielded 236 valid surveys from NKF donors and recipients (lay stakeholders). Survey B yielded 111 valid surveys from transplant professionals. Both sets of stakeholders support disclosing to donors some health and health behavior information of their exchange/chain donor and exchange/chain recipient, and mostly oppose disclosure of social information. Lay stakeholders favored disclosing significantly more information than transplant professionals. Among lay stakeholders, donor respondents were more supportive than recipient respondents in disclosing to donors health information about the exchange/chain recipient. Among transplant professionals, surgeons were more supportive than nephrologists in disclosing to donors information about the exchange/chain recipient that may impact graft survival.

1101;27568873;Article;2016;The Canadian journal of cardiology;;End-of-Life Decisions and Palliative Care in Advanced Heart Failure.;;Advanced heart failure (HF) therapies are focused on extending life and improving function. In contrast, palliative care is a holistic approach that focuses on symptom alleviation and patients' physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs. HF clinicians can integrate palliative care strategies by incorporating several important components of planning and decision-making for HF patients. Future care planning (FCP) for HF patients should incorporate the basic tenets of shared decision-making (SDM). These include understanding the patient's perspective and  care preferences, articulating what is medically feasible, and integrating these  considerations into the overall care plan. Use of defined triggers for FCP can stimulate important patient-caregiver conversations. Guidelines advocate an annual review of HF status and future care preferences. Advance directives are important for any individual with a chronic, life-limiting illness and should be  integrated into FCP. Nevertheless, use of advance directives by HF patients is extremely low. Consideration of illness trajectories and risk-scoring tools might facilitate prognostication and delivery of appropriate HF care. Decisions about heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device implantation should include planning for potential complications associated with these therapies. Such decisions also should include a discussion of palliative management, as an alternative to intervention and also as an option for managing symptoms or adverse events after intervention. Palliative care, including FCP and SDM, should be integrated into the course of all patients with advanced HF. Clinicians who provide HF care should acquire the skills necessary for conducting FCP and SDM discussions.;;Meyers DE, Goodlin SJ;;eng;['*Decision Making', 'Heart Failure/psychology/*therapy', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', '*Palliative Care', 'Patient Comfort', 'Patient Preference', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Prognosis'];;;;10.1016/j.cjca.2016.04.015

Moving the search for a living donor into the social media realm introduces the risk of unguided and coercive patient narratives as well as decoupling or even total absence of information that could aid the consent process. The Facebook application (app) for living donors, called Donor (restricted to patient use), aims to address these concerns in several ways: (i) by directing the patient's initial appeal to  friends and family; (ii) by guiding the patient's narrative; and (iii) by providing a library of clinical, ethical and regulatory information that informs  the consent process. In this paper, we explored these features and contrasted them with billboard solicitation activities and current independent social media  efforts.

1105;27500252;Article;2016;Transplantation direct;;Protection of Human Beings Trafficked for the Purpose of Organ Removal: Recommendations.;;This report presents a comprehensive set of recommendations for protection of human beings who are trafficked for the purpose of organ removal or are targeted  for such trafficking. Developed by an interdisciplinary group of international experts under the auspices of the project Trafficking in Human Beings for the Purpose of Organ Removal (also known as the HOTT project), these recommendations  are grounded in the view that an individual who parts with an organ for money within an illegal scheme is ipso facto a victim and that the crime of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ removal (THBOR) intersects with the crime of trafficking in organs. Consequently, the protection of victims should be a priority for all actors involved in antitrafficking activities: those combating organ-related crimes, such as health organizations and survivor support services, and those combating trafficking in human beings, such as the criminal justice sectors. Taking into account the special characteristics of THBOR, the authors identify 5 key stakeholders in the protection of human beings trafficked for organ removal or targeted for such trafficking: states, law enforcement agencies  and judiciary, nongovernmental organizations working in the areas of human rights and antitrafficking, transplant centers and health professionals involved in transplant medicine, and oversight bodies. For each stakeholder, the authors identify key areas of concern and concrete measures to identify and protect the victims of THBOR. The aim of the recommendations is to contribute to the development of a nonlegislative response to THBOR, to promote the exchange of knowledge and best practices in the area of victim protection, and to facilitate  the development of a policy-driven action plan for the protection of THBOR victims in the European Union and worldwide.;;Pascalev A, Van Assche K, Sandor J, Codreanu N, Naqvi A, Gunnarson M, Frunza M, Yankov J;;eng;;;;;10.1097/TXD.0000000000000565
1106;27500250;Article;2016;Transplantation direct;;Stimulating and Enhancing Partnerships Between Transplant Professionals and Law Enforcement: Recommendations.;;"To help combat trafficking in human beings for organ removal (THBOR), transplant  professionals need to do more than carry out careful, multidisciplinary screening of potential living donors; they also need to communicate and collaborate with law enforcement professionals. This will involve transplant professionals educating investigators and prosecutors about transplant practices and in turn learning about THBOR and how it is prosecuted. Cases of illegal organ transplantation need to be detected at different levels. First, the victims of the crime itself need to be identified, especially when they present themselves for screening. Physicians have a collective responsibility to prevent exploitation of people, including THBOR victims. The second level involves the more difficult matter of making reports that involve transplant tourists who have returned home after receipt of an organ and need follow-up care. Besides counseling patients prospectively about the legal as well as medical risks in receiving a vended organ in a foreign transplant center, physicians treating such patients could have an obligation to report what has happened, if the government  has established a mechanism that either allows reporting THBOR that does not include the identity of the patient or that treats patients as victims provided they cooperate in investigation and prosecution of the persons responsible for obtaining or implanting the organs. The third level of cooperation involves transplant professionals who participate in THBOR. Professional societies need to undertake programs to make physicians and nurses aware that their responsibility  to protect their professions' reputation includes identifying members of their professions who depart from professional ethics. Doing so allows the local professional societies and state boards to discipline such violators. All 3 of these functions would be facilitated by the creation by an international body such as World Health Organization of a registry of patients who travel internationally to receive a legitimate organ transplant.";;Capron AM, Muller E, Erlich G, John M, Bienstock RE, McCarren M, Palmer R, Scheper-Hughes N, Siegel D, Yankov J;;eng;;;;;10.1097/TXD.0000000000000567

Current guidelines stipulate waiting between 3 and 10 years after melanoma diagnosis. However, in young patients with end-stage organ failure and malignant  melanoma, complex ethical and moral issues arise. Assessment of the true risk associated with transplantation in these patients is difficult due to lack of prospective data, but an autonomous patient can make a decision that clinicians may perceive to be high risk. The national and worldwide shortage of available organs also has to be incorporated into the decision to maximize the net benefit  and minimize the risk of graft failure and mortality. The incidence of malignant  melanoma worldwide is increasing faster than that of any other cancer and continues to pose ethically challenging decisions for transplant specialists evaluating recipients for solid organ transplantation.;;Kirby LC, Banerjee A, Augustine T, Douglas JF;;eng;['Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/*complications', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/methods', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreas Transplantation/*ethics/methods', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications'];;;;10.1111/bjd.14554

The limits of the machine-body have been negotiated in science fiction, most canonically in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818). Since then, Frankenstein's monster itself has become a motif that permeates both medical and fictional discourses. Neal Shusterman's contemporary dystology for young adults, Unwind, draws on traditional concepts of the machine-body and the Frankenstein myth. This article follows one of the young protagonists in the series, who is entirely constructed from donated tissue, and analyses how Shusterman explores the complicated relationship between body and mind and between self and other as the  teenager matures into an adult. It will be shown that, by framing the story of a  transplanted individual along the lines of a coming-of-age narrative, Shusterman  inter-relates the acceptance of a donor organ with the transitional space of adolescence and positions the quest for embodied selfhood at the centre of both developments. By highlighting the interconnections between medical discourse and  a literary tradition, the potential contribution of the series to the treatment and understanding of post-transplant patients will be addressed.;;Wohlmann A, Steinberg R;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Image', 'History, 19th Century', 'Humans', '*Literature, Modern/history', '*Medicine in Literature', '*Metaphor', '*Mind-Body Relations, Metaphysical', 'Mythology', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Science'];;;;10.1136/medhum-2016-010918

However, elderly patients (ie >/=65 years of age) are still  more rarely referred or accepted to waiting lists and, if enlisted, have less chances of actually receiving a kidney allograft, than younger counterparts. In this review, we looked at evidence for the benefits and risks of RT in the elderly trying to answer the following questions: Should RT be advocated for elderly patients? What should be the criteria to accept elderly patients on the waiting list for RT? What strategies might be used to increase the rate of RT in  waitlisted elderly candidates? For selected elderly patients, RT was shown to be  superior to dialysis in terms of patient survival. Virtually all guidelines recommend that patients should not be deemed ineligible for RT based on age alone, although a short life expectancy generally might preclude RT. Concerning the assessment of comorbidities in the elderly, special attention should be paid  to cardiac evaluation and screening for malignancy. Comorbidity scores and frailty assessment scales might help the decision making on eligibility. Psychosocial issues should also be evaluated. To overcome the scarcity of organ donors, elderly RT candidates should be encouraged to consider expanded criteria  donors and living donors, as alternatives to deceased standard criteria donors. It has been demonstrated that expanded criteria donor RT in patients 60 years or  older is associated with higher survival rates than remaining on dialysis, whereas living donor RT is superior to all other options.;;Segall L, Nistor I, Pascual J, Mucsi I, Guirado L, Higgins R, Van Laecke S, Oberbauer R, Van Biesen W, Abramowicz D, Gavrilovici C, Farrington K, Covic A;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology', 'Frail Elderly', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Risk Reduction Behavior'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000001367

1114;27465167;Article;2016;Plastic and reconstructive surgery;;Ethical Issues in Pediatric Face Transplantation: Should We Perform Face Transplantation in Children?;;"BACKGROUND: In 2005, face transplantation ceased to be fiction and became a scientific reality. Today, 10 teams from six different countries have performed 32 face transplantations. Immunosuppressive treatments are similar to other solid organ transplants, and patients have experienced a significant functional improvement. The authors are logically considering expanding face transplantation to children; however, children are not simply small adults. METHODS: The authors  searched for pediatric patients in need of restoration of fundamental functions of the face, such as orbicularis oris or oculi muscle closure by, first, selecting cases from a pediatric plastic surgery reference center and, second, analyzing the feasibility of face transplantation in those patients. The authors  then identified the specific problems that they would encounter during a pediatric face transplant. The authors identified three potential candidates for  pediatric face transplantation. RESULTS: Children's youth imposes additional ethical and psychological considerations, such as the balance of risk to benefit  when it is quality of life, not life itself, that is at stake; the process of informed consent; the selection process; and the protection of privacy against media exposure. The question becomes not whether children should be included as candidates for face transplantation but whether any ethical barriers should preclude children as candidates for a full face transplant. CONCLUSION: After careful consideration of the physical, psychological, and ethical aspects of such a procedure, the authors found no such barrier that would either disqualify such  vulnerable subjects as profoundly disfigured children or conflict with their best interests.";;Marchac A, Kuschner T, Paris J, Picard A, Vazquez MP, Lantieri L;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Child', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'Face/*surgery', 'Facial Transplantation/*ethics/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Male', '*Quality of Life', 'Surgery, Plastic/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0000000000002387

""High priority"" initiatives include empowering transplant candidates and their loved ones in their search for a living kidney donor. Transplant programs are assuming  an unprecedented role as facilitators of patients' solicitation for donors, and nonprofits are promoting living kidney donation (LKD) in the community. New strategies to promote LKD incorporate ""nonargumentative"" forms of influence (i.e. approaches to shaping behavior that do not attempt to persuade through reason) such as appeals to emotion, messenger effects and social norms. These approaches  have raised ethical concerns in other settings but have received little attention in the transplantation literature despite their increasing relevance.

This is largely attributable to the opioid epidemic. If the unfortunate deaths of otherwise healthy people have yielded an increase in organ  donors, then this might serve as perhaps the only comforting factor among this tragic and unnecessary loss of life. In this viewpoint, we present data from the  Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) that show how the greatest relative increases in the mechanism of death among deceased donors from 2003 to 2014 were drug overdoses. Unfortunately, despite the absolute increase in the number of donors who died from a drug overdose, the mean organ yield was significantly lower than in other categories, in part due to concerns about disease transmission. In this paper, we present data on the changes in donation from donors with a drug overdose as a result of the opioid epidemic and discuss the need to educate transplant candidates and their physicians about the low risk of disease transmission compared to the greater risk of dying on a transplant waitlist.;;Goldberg DS, Blumberg E, McCauley M, Abt P, Levine M;;eng;['Donor Selection/*standards', 'Drug Overdose', '*Epidemics', 'Humans', '*Opioid-Related Disorders', 'Patient Safety', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*standards'];['*donors and donation', '*donors and donation: deceased', '*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics and public policy', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;R01 DK106243/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.13971
1119;27422340;Article;2016;Xenotransplantation;;Acceptance of organ xenotransplantation among Latin American immigrants resident  in the United States.;;"BACKGROUND: Making xenotransplantation socially acceptable is the first step in working toward the promotion of this potential therapy option for providing transplant organs. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the attitude toward xenotransplantation  among the Latin American population resident in Florida (the USA), and to determine the variables affecting this attitude. METHODS: A sample of Latin American residents in the state of Florida was randomized and stratified according to nationality, age, and sex (n = 1524). Attitude was assessed using a  validated questionnaire (PCID-XenoTx Rios) which was self-completed anonymously.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: descriptive analysis, Student's t-test, the chi-square test, and a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire completion rate was 95% (n = 1450). If it was assumed that xenotransplanted organs functioned as well as human ones, 10% (n = 147) would be in favor, 73% (n = 1092) against, and 17% (n = 246) undecided. If the results were worse, only 2% (n = 35) would be in favor. This favorable attitude was related to country of origin (Honduras and Guatemala; P < 0.001); age (P < 0.001); sex (women; P < 0.001); marital status (married; P < 0.001); descendents (yes; P < 0.001); level of formal education (secondary education and university; P < 0.001); participation in voluntary prosocial activities (yes; P < 0.001); having spoken about donation  and transplantation within the family (yes; P < 0.001); a partner's favorable attitude toward transplantation (P = 0.040); religion (catholic; P < 0.001); knowing the attitude of one's religion toward donation (yes; P < 0.001); previous experience of donation and/or transplantation (yes; P < 0.001); a belief that one might need a transplant in the future (yes; P < 0.001); and a favorable attitude  toward human donation (yes; P < 0.001). The following were associated with attitude in the multivariate analysis: age (>/=40 yrs; OR = 1.152); marital status (married; OR = 500); prosocial activities (yes, I participate in them; OR  = 9.196. No, but I would like to; OR = 332.538); religion (catholic; OR = 2000);  attitude toward deceased organ donation (in favor; OR = 2000); and previous experience of donation and/or transplantation (yes; OR = 500).

This study explored the perspectives of relatives regarding the  request for consent for donation in cases without donor registration. METHODS: A  content analysis of narratives of 24 bereaved relatives (14 in-depth interviews and one letter) of unregistered, eligible, brain-dead donors was performed. RESULTS: Relatives of unregistered, brain-dead patients usually refuse consent for donation, even if they harbour pro-donation attitudes themselves, or knew that the deceased favoured organ donation. Half of those who refused consent for  donation mentioned afterwards that it could have been an option. The decision not to consent to donation is attributed to contextual factors, such as feeling overwhelmed by the notification of death immediately followed by the request; not being accustomed to speaking about death; inadequate support from other relatives or healthcare professionals, and lengthy procedures. CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals could provide better support to relatives prior to donation requests, address their informational needs and adapt their message to individual circumstances. It is anticipated that the number of consenting families could be  enlarged by examining the experience of decoupling and offering the possibility of consent for donation after circulatory death if families refuse consent for donation after brain-death.";;de Groot J, van Hoek M, Hoedemaekers C, Hoitsma A, Schilderman H, Smeets W, Vernooij-Dassen M, van Leeuwen E;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'Aged', '*Attitude', 'Bereavement', 'Brain Death', '*Death', '*Decision Making', '*Emotions', '*Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Qualitative Research', 'Registries', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Young Adult'];['*Decision making by proxies', '*Donor registration', '*Ethics', '*Informational needs', '*Organ transplantation', '*Professional-family relations'];;;10.1186/s12910-016-0120-6

This paper explains and criticizes the paediatric priority. We set out the relevant ethical principles of allocation, such as utility and severity, and the relevant facts to do with such matters as sensitization and child development. We argue that the facts and principles do not support and sometimes conflict with the priority given to children. We next consider various views on how age or the status of children should affect allocation. Again, these views do not support priority to children in its current form. Since distinctions based on age ought to be positively justified, the failure of all these attempts at justification implies that the priority to children is ethically mistaken. Finally, the paper points to evidence that the paediatric priority reduces the overall supply of kidneys, at least in the United States. Paediatric priority is a real-world policy that seems discriminatory, in  some places probably reduces the supply of organs, has no robust official defence, and is unsupported by mainstream ethical principles. Consequently, it should be ended.;;Wilkinson TM, Dittmer ID;;eng;['Child', 'Ethical Analysis', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Health Priorities/*ethics', 'Humans', '*Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Morals', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'United States'];['Age discrimination', 'Justice', 'Kidney allocation', 'Live donation', 'Paediatric priority', 'Utility'];;;10.1007/s11673-016-9737-x
1125;27381404;Article;2016;Medicine, science, and the law;;Ethico-legal issues related to ovarian tissue transplantation.;;Ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT) is a promising experimental method which may soon become well-established. In cases of minor oncology, where patients' fertility is seriously threatened by treatment, it may be applied as a unique fertility preservation option. OTT has a dual nature ('organ' and 'gamete'). Many stakeholders are involved, including donor, recipient, child, health-care providers and society at large. There is considerable uncertainty about the long-term consequences of the application of OTT and OT cryopreservation (OTC). Thus, application of OTT gives rise to a number of very different ethico-legal issues and dilemmas which are hard to solve coherently through a principlism-based bioethical approach. This study focuses on such dilemmas and attempts to review them. The role of virtue ethics, which may be combined with principlism, is essential to solve such dilemmas coherently and reasonably. Dealing with conflicts of ethical principles equivalent between them, or moral dilemmas without available answers and mind-sharing in a difficult interpersonal  process of decision making, requires a virtue-based ethical approach. Besides, ethico-legal issues related to OTC/OTT are complex issues requiring a multidisciplinary approach (ethical considerations, medical, psychological and social evaluations etc.). We stress the crucial role of multidisciplinary Ethics  Committee which is considered indispensable for each reproductive health-care unit practicing OTC/OTT.;;Voultsos P, Raikos N, Vasileiadis N, Spiliopoulou C, Tarlatzis B;;eng;;['Ovarian tissue transplantation', 'bioethical principles', 'health', 'oncofertility', 'ovarian tissue cryopreservation', 'virtue ethics'];;;10.1177/0025802416657685

Patients are given  VADs, without the prospect of care escalation to transplantation. VADs are now established therapy for children and are currently used as a bridge until transplantation can be performed or heart failure improves. For children who present in severe heart failure but do not meet transplantation criteria, the question has emerged whether DT can be offered. This qualitative study aimed to elicit the perspectives of early adopters of DT at one of the few institutions where DT has been provided for children. Responses were recorded and coded and themes extracted using grounded theory. Interviewees discussed: envisioning of the DT candidate; approach to evaluation for DT; contraindications to choosing DT; and concerns about choosing DT. Providers articulated two frameworks for conceptualizing DT: as a long bridge through resolution of problems that would initially contraindicate transplantation or, alternatively, as a true destination instead of transplantation.

1128;27356872;Article;2016;Stem cell research & therapy;;Human-animal chimeras: ethical issues about farming chimeric animals bearing human organs.;;Recent advances in stem cells and gene engineering have paved the way for the generation of interspecies chimeras, such as animals bearing an organ from another species. The production of a rat pancreas by a mouse has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. The next step will be the generation of larger chimeric animals, such as pigs bearing human organs. Because of the dramatic organ shortage for transplantation, the medical needs for such a transgressive practice are indisputable. However, there are serious technical barriers and complex ethical issues that must be discussed and solved before producing human organs in animals. The main ethical issues are the risks of consciousness and of  human features in the chimeric animal due to a too high contribution of human cells to the brain, in the first case, or for instance to limbs, in the second. Another critical point concerns the production of human gametes by such chimeric  animals. These worst-case scenarios are obviously unacceptable and must be strictly monitored by careful risk assessment, and, if necessary, technically prevented. The public must be associated with this ethical debate. Scientists and physicians have a critical role in explaining the medical needs, the advantages and limits of this potential medical procedure, and the ethical boundaries that must not be trespassed. If these prerequisites are met, acceptance of such a new, borderline medical procedure may prevail, as happened before for in-vitro fertilization or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.;;Bourret R, Martinez E, Vialla F, Giquel C, Thonnat-Marin A, De Vos J;;eng;['Animals', '*Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*genetics', 'Chimera/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Rats', 'Swine'];['Animals', 'Animals Containing Human Material', 'Chimera', 'Human organs', 'Induced pluripotent stem cells', 'Interspecies chimera'];;;10.1186/s13287-016-0345-9
1129;27355820;Article;2016;Transplantation;;Statement of the Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group Regarding Payments to Families of Deceased Organ Donors.;;"Governmental and private programs that pay next of kin who give permission for the removal of their deceased relative's organs for transplantation exist in a number of countries. Such payments, which may be given to the relatives or paid directly for funeral expenses or hospital bills unrelated to being a donor, aim to increase the rate of donation. The Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group-in  alignment with the World Health Organization Guiding Principles and the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Organs-has adopted a new policy statement opposing such practices. Payment programs are unwise because they produce a lower rate of donations than in countries with voluntary, unpaid programs; associate deceased donation with being poor and marginal in society; undermine public trust in the determination of death; and raise doubts about fair allocation of organs. Most important, allowing families to receive money for donation from a deceased person, who is at no risk of harm, will make it impossible to sustain prohibitions on paying living donors, who are at risk. Payment programs are also unethical. Tying coverage for funeral expenses or healthcare costs to a family allowing organs to be procured is exploitative, not  ""charitable."" Using payment to overcome reluctance to donate based on cultural or religious beliefs especially offends principles of liberty and dignity. Finally,  while it is appropriate to make donation ""financially neutral""-by reimbursing the added medical costs of evaluating and maintaining a patient as a potential donor-such reimbursement may never be conditioned on a family agreeing to donate.";;Capron AM, Delmonico FL, Dominguez-Gil B, Martin DE, Danovitch GM, Chapman J;;eng;['Cause of Death', '*Compensation and Redress/ethics', 'Conflict of Interest/*economics', '*Family', 'Humans', 'Motivation', 'Public Opinion', '*Tissue Donors/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/ethics'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000001198

METHODS: Randomised, double blind, controlled trial in which community  members watched one of two videos of a simulated organ donation conversation that differed only in the amount of information provided about the benefits of donation. Participants then completed a questionnaire about the adequacy of the information provided and the degree to which they felt the doctor was trying to convince the family member to say yes to donation. RESULTS: There was a wide variability in what participants considered was the ""right"" amount of information about organ donation. Those who watched the conversation that included information about the benefits of donation were more likely to feel that the information provided to the family was sufficient. They were more likely to report that the doctor was trying to convince the family member to say yes to donation, yet were no more likely to feel uncomfortable or to feel that the doctor was uncaring or cared more about transplant recipients than he did for the patient and their family.

Unknown is whether donation increases the risk of kidney  failure in living donors with 2 ApoL1 risk alleles and whether their donated kidneys have worse graft survival. There are 4 options to consider: (1) remain silent about ApoL1 risk alleles and renal failure and wait for more data; (2) counsel about race, ApoL1, and subsequent renal failure abstractly but remain agnostic about donor testing until more data are available; (3) provide counseling and encourage genotyping of prospective living donors of African ancestry as part of the living donor workup; or (4) mandate testing of all prospective living donors.

However, because they are novel, kidney chains do not fit neatly within existing  legal and ethicalframeworks, raising potential barriers to their full implementation. Kidney chains are an extension of paired kidney donation, which began in the United States in 2000. Paired kidney donations allow kidney patients with willing, but incompatible, donors to swap donors to increase the number of donor/recipient pairs and consequently, the number of transplants. More recently, transplant centers have been using non-simultaneous, extended, altruistic donor (""NEAD"") kidney chains--which consist of a sequence of donations by incompatible  donors--to further expand the number of donations. This Article fully explains paired kidney donation and kidney chains and focuses on whether NEAD chains are more coercive than traditional kidney donation to a family member or close friend and whether NEAD chains violate the National Organ Transplant Act's prohibition on the transfer of organs for valuable consideration.";;Tenenbaum EM;;eng;['Coercion', 'Directed Tissue Donation/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Donor Selection/ethics', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/ethics/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];;;;10.1177/0098858816644719

The informed consent process is therefore valued differently. Although this is a team effort, the surgeon is responsible for performing the donor nephrectomy, and often the one held accountable, should adverse events occur. Although there is some consensus on how the informed consent procedure should be arranged, practices vary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical informed consent procedure for live donor nephrectomy, with special regards to disclosure of complications. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to all kidney transplant surgeons (n = 50) in eight transplant centers with questions regarding the local procedure and disclosure of specific details. RESULTS: Response rate was 98% (n = 49), of which 32 (65%) were involved in living donor education; overall, transplant- (50%), vascular- (31%),  and abdominal surgeons (13%), and urologists (6%) performed donor nephrectomies in the eight centers. Informed consent procedures varied, ranging from assumed to signed consent. Bleeding was the only complication every surgeon mentioned. Risk  of death was always mentioned by 16 surgeons (50%), sometimes by 13 (41%), three  surgeons (9%) never disclosed this disastrous complication. Reported mortality rates ranged from 0.003% to 0.1%. Mentioning frequencies for all other complications varied. CONCLUSION: Important complications are not always disclosed during the surgical informed consent process for live donor nephrectomy. Informed consent procedures vary.

However, it has always remained as a complicated topic from both medical and ethical grounds, as it is seen for many a ""self-inflicted disease"". Over the years, the survival rate of transplanted patients has significantly improved. The allocation system and the inclusion criteria for LT has also undergone some modifications. Early LT for acute alcoholic hepatitis has been subject to recent clinical studies with encouraging results in highly selected patients. We have learned from studies the importance of a multidisciplinary evaluation of candidates for LT. Complete abstinence should be  attempted to overcome addiction issues and to allow spontaneous liver recovery. Risk factors for relapse include the presence of anxiety or depressive disorder,  short duration of sobriety pre-LT and lack of social support. The identification  of risk factors and the strengthen of social support system may decrease relapse  among these patients. Family counseling of candidates is highly encouraged to prevent relapse to alcohol. Relapse has been associated with different histopathological changes, graft damage, graft loss and even decrease in survival among some studies. Therefore, each patient should be carefully selected and priority is to continue to lean on patients with high probability of success.

1143;27194322;Article;2016;BMJ open;;Why take the chance? A qualitative grounded theory study of nocturnal haemodialysis recipients who decline kidney transplantation.;;OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the factors that influence  decision-making to forgo transplantation in favour of remaining on nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD). DESIGN: A grounded theory approach using in-depth telephone  interviewing was used. SETTING: Participants were identified from 2 tertiary care renal programmes in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants were otherwise eligible patients with end-stage renal disease who have opted to remain off of the transplant list. A total of 7 eligible participants were interviewed. 5 were  male. The mean age was 46 years. ANALYSIS: A constant comparative method of analysis was used to identify a core category and factors influencing the decision-making process. RESULTS: In this grounded theory study of people receiving NHD who refused kidney transplantation, the core category of 'why take  a chance when things are going well?' was identified, along with 4 factors that influenced the decision including 'negative past experience', 'feeling well on NHD', 'gaining autonomy' and 'responsibility'. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into patients' thought processes surrounding an important treatment decision. Such insights might help the renal team to better understand, and thereby respect, patient choice in a patient-centred care paradigm. Findings may  also be useful in the development of education programmes addressing the specific concerns of this population of patients.;;Rosenthal MM, Molzahn AE, Chan CT, Cockfield SL, Kim SJ, Pauly RP;;eng;['Adult', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Grounded Theory', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression/adverse effects', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Renal Dialysis/methods/*psychology', 'Self Care', 'Treatment Refusal/*psychology', 'Uncertainty'];['*Decision-making', '*grounded theory', '*nocturnal hemodialysis'];;;10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011951

1146;27178671;Article;2016;Indian journal of medical ethics;;Trade in kidneys is ethically intolerable.;;In India, as in most countries where trade in human organs is legally prohibited, policies governing transplantation from living donors are designed to identify and exclude prospective donors who have a commercial interest in donation. The effective implementation of such policies requires resources, training and motivation on the part of health professionals responsible for organ procurement  and transplantation. If professionals are unconvinced by or unfamiliar with the ethical justification of the relevant laws and policies, they may fail to perform a robust evaluation of prospective donors and transplant candidates, and to act on suspicions or evidence of illicit activities. I comment here on a recent paper by Aggarwal and Adhikary (2016), in which the authors imply that tolerance of illicit commercialism in living kidney donation programmes is not unreasonable, given the insufficiency of kidneys available for transplantation. I argue that such tolerance is unethical not only because of the harmful consequences of kidney trafficking, but because professional tolerance of commercialism undermines public trust in organ procurement programmes and impairs the development of sustainable donation and transplant systems.;;Martin DE;;eng;['Humans', 'India', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Living Donors/ethics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.20529/IJME.2016.049

Whereas in the United States and Canada LD by minors has occasionally been reported, LD by minors seems to be largely absent in the European Union (EU). It is currently unclear whether this is the result of a different legal approach. This study is the first to systematically analyze the regulations of EU member states, Norway,  and Iceland toward LD by minors. Relevant regulations were identified by searching government websites, translated, compared, and sent for verification to national legal experts. We identified five countries where LD by minors is allowed. In two of these (Belgium and the United Kingdom), some minors may be deemed sufficiently mature to make an autonomous decision regarding LD. In contrast, in the three other countries (Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden), LD by minors is only allowed subject to parental permission and the assent (or absence  of objection) of the donor. Where allowed, regulations differ significantly with  regard to the substantive and procedural safeguards in place. In view of the controversial nature of the procedure, as illustrated by recent reports and surveys, we argue for a very cautious approach and greater harmonization in countries where LD by minors is allowed.;;Thys K, Van Assche K, Nys H, Sterckx S, Borry P;;eng;['Adolescent', '*Decision Making', 'European Union', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Living Donors/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Mental Competency/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Minors/*legislation & jurisprudence', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*legislation & jurisprudence'];['*donors and donation: living', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*law/legislation', '*pediatrics'];;;10.1111/ajt.13868

Effective culturally targeted interventions to increase knowledge are lacking. We developed a culturally targeted educational website to enhance informed treatment decision making for end-stage kidney disease. METHODS: A pretest/posttest intervention study was conducted among adult Hispanic patients undergoing dialysis at 5 dialysis centers in Chicago, Illinois. Surveys included a 31-item, multiple-choice pretest/posttest of knowledge about kidney transplantation and living donation, attitudes about the website, Internet use, and demographics. The intervention entailed viewing 3 of 6 website sections for a total of 30 minutes. The pretest/posttest was administered immediately before and after the intervention.  Participants completed a second posttest via telephone 3 weeks thereafter to assess knowledge retention, attitudes, and use of the website. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients participated (96% participation rate). Website exposure was  associated with a mean 17.1% same day knowledge score increase between pretest and posttest (P < .001). At 3 weeks, participants' knowledge scores remained 11.7% above pretest (P < .001). The greatest knowledge gain from pretest to 3-week follow-up occurred in the Treatment Options (P < .0001) and Cultural Beliefs and Myths (P < .0001) website sections. Most participants (95%) ""agreed""  or ""strongly agreed"" that they would recommend the website to other Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based education for patients undergoing dialysis can effectively increase Hispanics' knowledge about transplantation and living kidney donation.

1152;27126975;Article;2016;BMJ open;;Effect of FTY720 (fingolimod) on graft survival in renal transplant recipients: a systematic review protocol.;;INTRODUCTION: Studies have shown that FTY720 has inconsistent effects in kidney transplant recipients. Several review articles on FTY720 have been published, but most have focused on the mechanism of action of FTY720. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate and determine the beneficial and harmful effects of FTY720 therapy in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We electronically  searched the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, the Web of Sciences, EMBASE, Cochrane databases and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. Any clinical, randomised controlled trials relating to FTY720 for treating kidney transplant recipients were included without publication status or language restriction. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of study quality were performed independently by two researchers. Data were synthesised by either  the fixed effects or the random effects model according to a heterogeneity test.  If the extracted data were suitable for meta-analysis, STATA software was used to combine the relative risks for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean differences for continuous outcomes with 95% CIs were measured. Death, loss of function and incidence of acute kidney rejection were assessed as the primary outcomes. Renal  graft function, malignancy, delayed graft function and infection were evaluated as secondary outcomes. ETHICS/DISSEMINATION: This review does not require formal  ethics approval because the data are not individualised. The resulting review article will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

1155;27115404;Article;2016;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;Does the ethical appropriateness of paying donors depend on what body parts they  donate?;;"The idea of paying donors in order to make more human bodily material available for therapy, assisted reproduction, and biomedical research is notoriously controversial. However, while national and international donation policies largely oppose financial incentives they do not treat all parts of the body equally: incentives are allowed in connection to the provision of some parts but  not others. Taking off from this observation, I discuss whether body parts differ as regards the ethical legitimacy of incentives and, if so, why. I distinguish two approaches to this issue. On a ""principled"" approach, some but not all body parts are inherently special in a way that proscribes payment. On a ""pragmatic"" approach, the appropriateness of payment in relation to a specific part must be determined through an overall assessment of e.g. the implications of payment for  the health and welfare of providers, recipients, and third parties, and the quality of providers' consent. I argue that the first approach raises deep and potentially divisive questions about the good life, whereas the second approach invokes currently unsupported empirical assumptions and requires difficult balancing between different values and the interests of different people. This does not mean that any attempt to distinguish between body parts in regard to the appropriateness of payment necessarily fails. However, I conclude, any plausible  such attempt should either articulate and defend a specific view of the good life, or gather relevant empirical evidence and apply defensible principles for weighing goods and interests.";;Malmqvist E;;eng;['Costs and Cost Analysis/*ethics', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Human Body', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/ethics'];['Assisted reproduction', 'Biomedical research', 'Donation', 'Ethics', 'Payment', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1007/s11019-016-9705-6

METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 82 participants with 62 renal allograft recipients (2-4weeks after kidney transplantation) and 20 volunteers were enrolled to be scanned using IVIM and ASL MRI on a 3.0T MR scanner. Recipients were divided into two groups with either normal or impaired function according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with a threshold of 60ml/min/1.73m(2). The apparent diffusion coefficient  (ADC) of pure diffusion (ADCslow), the ADC of pseudodiffusion (ADCfast), perfusion fraction (PF), and renal blood flow (RBF) of cortex were compared among three groups. The correlation of ADCslow, ADCfast, PF and RBF with eGFR was evaluated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and binary logistic  regression analyses were performed to assess the diagnostic efficiency of using IVIM and ASL parameters to discriminate allografts with impaired function from normal function. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In allografts with normal function, no significant difference of mean cortical ADCslow, ADCfast, and PF was found compared with healthy controls (P>0.05). Cortical RBF in allografts with normal function was statistically lower than that of healthy controls (P<0.001). Mean cortical ADCslow, ADCfast, PF and RBF were lower for allografts with impaired function than that with normal function (P<0.05). Mean cortical ADCslow, ADCfast, PF and RBF showed a positive correlation with eGFR (all P<0.01) for recipients. The combination of IVIM and ASL MRI showed a higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) (0.865) than that of ASL MRI alone (P=0.02). CONCLUSION: Combined IVIM and ASL MRI can better evaluate the diffusion and perfusion properties for allografts early after kidney transplantation.;;Ren T, Wen CL, Chen LH, Xie SS, Cheng Y, Fu YX, Oesingmann N, de Oliveira A, Zuo PL, Yin JZ, Xia S, Shen W;;eng;['Adult', 'Creatinine/*blood', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Kidney/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Renal Circulation/physiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult'];['*ASL', '*Diagnostic efficacy', '*IVIM', '*Renal allograft'];;;10.1016/j.mri.2016.04.022

Access to dialysis and transplantation is regulated by the Ministry of Health, based on clinical criteria, applied equitably, without favoritism or discrimination based on race, sex, economic means, or political power. Until December 2013, there were no restrictions in dialysis and transplantation in Health Insurance institutions, but they covered only 30% of the population. Now the remaining 70% has access to free dialysis funded by the communities where patients live, with funds coming from the government and taxes on oil products. More than 2,231 people are getting dialysis, reaching a population growth of >60% annually. The number of hemodialysis units has increased by >200% (60 units), making access easier for end-stage renal failure patients. Treatment protocols have been drawn up to guarantee the best quality of life for the patients. The Law on Donation and Transplantation was enacted in 1996, and Supplementary Regulations were enacted in 1997 with various amendments over the past 5 years.

Among 67 706 ESLD Medicaid patients, 3-year incidences of waitlisting and transplantation were 10.0% (9.7-10.4%) and 6.7% (6.5-7.0%), respectively. In HealthCore, the absolute ranges in states' waitlist mortality and transplant rates were larger than corresponding ranges among all ESLD patients (waitlist mortality: 13.6-38.5%, ESLD 3-year mortality: 48.9-62.0%; waitlist transplant rates: 36.3-72.7%, ESLD transplant rates: 4.8-13.4%). States' waitlist mortality and ESLD population mortality were  not positively correlated: rho = -0.06, p-value = 0.83 (HealthCore); rho = -0.87, p-value = 0.05 (Medicaid). Waitlist and ESLD transplant rates were weakly positively correlated in Medicaid (rho = 0.36, p-value = 0.55) but were positively correlated in HealthCore (rho = 0.73, p-value = 0.001).

1164;27054221;Book;2016;;NIHR Journals Library;;Increasing the acceptability and rates of organ donation among minority ethnic groups: a programme of observational and evaluative research on Donation, Transplantation and Ethnicity (DonaTE);"BACKGROUND: Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have a high need for organ transplantation but deceased donation is low. This restricts the availability of well-matched organs and results in relatively long waiting times  for transplantation, with increased mortality risks. OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to organ donor registration and family consent among the BAME population, and to develop and evaluate a training intervention to enhance communication with ethnic minority families and identify impacts on family consent. METHODS: Three-phase programme comprising (1) community-based research involving two systematic reviews examining attitudes and barriers to organ donation and effective interventions followed by 22 focus groups with minority ethnic groups; (2) hospital-based research examining staff practices and influences on family consent through ethics discussion groups (EDGs) with staff,  a study on intensive care units (ICUs) and interviews with bereaved ethnic minority families; and (3) development and evaluation of a training package to enhance cultural competence among ICU staff. SETTING: Community focus group study in eight London boroughs with high prevalence of ethnic minority populations. Hospital studies at five NHS hospital trusts (three in London and two in Midlands). PARTICIPANTS: (1) Community studies: 228 focus group participants; (2) hospital studies: 35 nurses, 28 clinicians, 19 hospital chaplains, 25 members of  local Organ Donation Committees, 17 bereaved family members; and (3) evaluation:  66 health professionals. DATA SOURCES: Focus groups with community residents, systematic reviews, qualitative interviews and observation in ICUs, EDGs with ICU staff, bereaved family interviews and questionnaires for trial evaluation. REVIEW METHODS: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: (1) Community studies: Organ Donor Register - different ethnic/faith and age groups were at varying points on the 'pathway' to organ donor registration, with large numbers lacking knowledge and remaining at a pre-contemplation stage. Key attitudinal barriers were uncertainties regarding religious permissibility, bodily concerns,  lack of trust in health professionals and little priority given to registration,  with the varying significance of these factors varying by ethnicity/faith and age. National campaigns focusing on ethnic minorities have had limited impact, whereas characteristics of effective educational interventions are being conducted in a familiar environment; addressing the groups' particular concerns;  delivery by trained members of the lay community; and providing immediate access  to registration. Interventions are also required to target those at specific stages of the donation pathway. (2) Hospital studies: family consent to donation  - many ICU staff, especially junior nurses, described a lack of confidence in communication and supporting ethnic minority families, often reflecting differences in emotional expression, faith and cultural beliefs, and language difficulties. The continuing high proportion of family donation discussions that  take place without the collaboration of a specialist nurse for organ donation (SNOD) reflected consultants' views of their own role in family consent to donation, a lack of trust in SNODs and uncertainties surrounding controlled donations after circulatory (or cardiac) death. Hospital chaplains differed in their involvement in ICUs, reflecting their availability/employment status, personal interests and the practices of ICU staff. (3) Evaluation: professional development package - a digital versatile disk-based training package was developed to promote confidence and skills in cross-cultural communication (available at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueaR6XYkeVM&feature=youtu.be). Initial evaluation produced positive feedback and significant affirmative attitudinal change but no significant difference in consent rate over the short follow-up period with requirements for longer-term evaluation. LIMITATIONS: Participants in the focus group study were mainly first-generation migrants of manual socioeconomic groups. It was not permitted to identify non-consenting families for interview with data regarding the consent process were therefore limited to consenting families. CONCLUSIONS: The research presents guidance for the effective targeting of donation campaigns focusing on minority ethnic groups and  provides the first training package in cultural competence in the NHS. FUTURE WORK: Greater evaluation is required of community interventions in the UK to enhance knowledge of effective practice and analysis of the experiences of non-consenting ethnic minority families.

While most donation-related medical expenses are covered, many donors still face lost wages, travel expenses, incidentals, and potential for future insurability problems. Despite widespread consensus that live donors (LD) should not be responsible for the costs associated with donation, little has changed to alleviate financial burdens for LDs in the last decade. To achieve this goal, the transplant community must actively pursue strategies and policies  to eliminate unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs to LDs. Costs should be more appropriately distributed across all stakeholders; this will also make live donation possible for people who, in the current system, cannot afford to proceed.

Donor education, leading to informed consent, needs to be carried out according to certain standards. Informed consent procedures for live donor nephrectomy vary per centre, and even per individual healthcare professional. The basis for a standardised, uniform surgical informed consent procedure for live donor nephrectomy can be created by assessing what information donors need to hear to prepare them for the operation and convalescence. METHODS  AND ANALYSIS: The PRINCE (Process of Informed Consent Evaluation) project is a prospective, multicentre cohort study, to be carried out in all eight Dutch kidney transplant centres. Donor knowledge of the procedure and postoperative course will be evaluated by means of pop quizzes. A baseline cohort (prior to receiving any information from a member of the transplant team in one of the transplant centres) will be compared with a control group, the members of which receive the pop quiz on the day of admission for donor nephrectomy. Donor satisfaction will be evaluated for all donors who completed the admission pop-quiz. The primary end point is donor knowledge. In addition, those elements that have to be included in the standardised format informed consent procedure will be identified. Secondary end points are donor satisfaction, current informed consent practices in the different centres (eg, how many visits, which personnel, what kind of information is disclosed, in which format, etc) and correlation of donor knowledge with surgeons' estimation thereof. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for this study was obtained from the medical ethical committee of the Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, on 18 February 2015. Secondary  approval has been obtained from the local ethics committees in six participating  centres. Approval in the last centre has been sought.

1171;27036112;Article;2016;Trials;;A randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of CO-oximetry and anti-smoking brief advice in a cohort of kidney transplant patients who smoke: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.;;BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular risk in renal transplant patients is increased in  patients who continue to smoke after transplantation. The aim of the study is to  measure the effectiveness of exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) measurement plus brief  advisory sessions, in comparison to brief advice, to reduce smoking exposure and  smoking behavior in kidney transplant recipients who smoke. The effectiveness will be measured by: (1) abandonment of smoking, (2) increase in motivation to stop smoking, and (3) reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked per day. METHODS/DESIGN: DESIGN: a randomized, controlled, open clinical trial with blinded evaluation. SCOPE: A Coruna Hospital (Spain), reference to renal transplantation in the period 2012-2015. INCLUSION CRITERIA: renal transplant patients who smoke in the precontemplation, contemplation or preparation stages according to the Prochaska and DiClemente's Stages of Change model, and who give  their consent to participate. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: smokers attempting to stop smoking, patients with terminal illness or mental disability that prevents them from participating. RANDOMIZATION: patients will be randomized to the control group (brief advisory session) or the intervention group (brief advisory session  plus measuring exhaled CO). The sample target size is n = 112, with 56 patients in each group. Allowing for up to 10 % loss to follow-up, this would provide 80 % power to detect a 13 % difference in attempting to give up smoking outcomes at a  two-tailed significance level of 5 %. MEASUREMENTS: sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, treatment, rejection episodes, infections, self-reported smoking habit, drug use, level of dependence (the Fagerstrom test), stage of change (Prochaska and DiClemente's Stages of Change model), and motivation to giving up smoking (the Richmond test). RESPONSE: the effectiveness will be evaluated every 3, 6, 9 and 12 months as: pattern of tobacco use (self-reported tobacco use), smoking cessation rates, carbon monoxide (CO) levels in exhaled air measured by CO-oximetry, urinary cotinine tests, nicotine dependence (Fagerstrom test), motivational stages of change (Prochaska and DiClemente's stages) and motivation to stop smoking (the Richmond test). ANALYSIS: descriptive statistics and linear/logistic multiple regression models will be performed. Clinical relevance will be measured as relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat. ETHICS: informed consent of the patients and Ethical Review Board was obtained (code 2011/061). DISCUSSION: Tobacco is a modifiable risk factor that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. If effectiveness of CO-oximetry is confirmed to reduce tobacco exposure, we would have an intervention that is easy to use, low cost and with great implications about cardiovascular risk prevention in these patients.

1172;27030483;Article;2016;Journal of medical ethics;;Premortem interventions in dying children to optimise organ donation: an ethical  analysis.;;A range of interventions in dying patients can improve both the possibility of successful organ donation and the likely long-term success of transplantation. The ethical and legal issues surrounding such interventions, which most frequently occur in the context of donation after circulatory determination of death, are complex, controversial and many remain unresolved. This is true with adults, but even more so with children, where the issue of organ donation and premortem interventions to facilitate it, are highly sensitive. Essentially, such interventions are being undertaken in dying children who cannot medically benefit from them, though arguments have been advanced that becoming a donor might be in  a child's extended best interest. However, certain interventions carry a potential risk, although small, of direct harm and of course overall objections to child donation after circulatory determination of death per se are still expressed in the literature. But, unlike the case in critically ill adults, those giving permission for such interventions are normally able to fully participate in decision-making, and indeed to consent, to both donation and premortem interventions. We review the issue of the use of premortem interventions in dying children to facilitate organ donation, including decision-making and ethical justification. Individual interventions are then considered, including an ethical analyse of their use. Finally, we recommend an approach using a combination of welfare checklist strategy, coupled with the establishment of an agreed zone of parental discretion about individual interventions which might be used in dying children to increase the possibility of successful organ donation.;;Brierley J, Shaw D;;eng;['Brain Death', 'Child', 'Decision Making', '*Ethical Analysis', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Parents/*psychology', '*Pediatrics/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];['*Allocation of Organs/Tissues', '*Allowing Minors to Die', '*Care of Dying Minors', '*Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues', '*Minors/Parental Consent'];;;10.1136/medethics-2015-103098

While the techniques used in kidney transplantation surgery are mature and highly successful, there is a severe shortage of donor organs. Statistics show a serious imbalance between organ donations and patients on the waiting list for organ transplantation. Moreover, evidence from empirical studies has shown a better transplantation outcome for patients who receive living donor transplantation than for those who receive organs from cadavers. Although using relatives as donors offers an effective way to reduce the problem of organ shortage, this strategy faces many challenges and many other factors affect the promotion of living donor transplantation.

In 2008, Israel's Parliament passed the Organ Transplantation Law, which grants priority on waiting lists for transplants to candidates who are first-degree relatives of deceased organ donors or who previously registered as organ donors themselves. Several public campaigns have advertised the existence of the law since November 2010. We evaluated the effect of the law using all deceased donation requests made in Israel during the period 1998-2015. We use logistic regression to compare the authorization rates of the donors' next of kin in the periods before (1998-2010) and after (2011-2015) the public was made aware of the law. The authorization rate for donation in the period after awareness was substantially higher (55.1% vs. 45.0%, odds ratio [OR] 1.43, p = 0.0003) and reached an all-time high rate of 60.2% in 2015. This increase was mainly due to an increase in the authorization rate of next of kin of unregistered donors (51.1% vs. 42.2%). We also found that the likelihood of next-of-kin authorization for donation was approximately twice as high when the deceased relative was a registered donor rather than unregistered (89.4% vs. 44.6%, OR 14.27, p < 0.0001). We concluded that the priority law is associated with an increased authorization rate for organ donation.;;Stoler A, Kessler JB, Ashkenazi T, Roth AE, Lavee J;;eng;['Brain Death/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Family', '*Health Plan Implementation', 'Humans', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical  data/trends', 'Waiting Lists'];['*donors and donation: deceased', '*donors and donation: incentives', '*ethics and public policy', '*law/legislation', '*organ procurement', '*organ transplantation in general'];;;10.1111/ajt.13802

Preliminary results of procedures that have been performed until now demonstrate that this leads to good medical results in the recipient of the organs. Several legal aspects could be changed to further facilitate the combination of organ donation and euthanasia. On the ethical side, several controversies remain, giving rise to an ongoing, but necessary and useful debate. Further experiences will clarify whether both procedures should be strictly separated and whether the dead donor rule should be strictly applied. Opinions still differ on whether the patient's physician should address the possibility of organ donation after euthanasia, which laws should be adapted and  which preparatory acts should be performed.

We reviewed cDCDD protocols using ECMO and the relevant ethics literature to analyze these issues. It is not obvious that ECMO in cDCDD improves graft outcomes. In our opinion, ECMO implemented before death can interfere with end-of-life care and damage bodily integrity. By  restoring systemic circulation, ECMO risks invalidating the preceding declaration of death if brain and cardiac perfusion is not adequately excluded because of malfunction or misplacement of the supradiaphragmatic aortic occlusion balloon. The use of ECMO is not compatible with the acronym DCDD because circulation is restored after the determination of death. Because of these deficiencies, we concluded that other techniques are preferable, such as rapid recovery or in situ cold infusion.

This paper discusses the ethics of using OP-ECMO in donation after brain determination of death (DBDD) to  avoid the loss of organs for transplantation. We review case reports in the literature and analyze the ethical issues raised. We conclude that there is little additional ethical concern in continuing OP-ECMO in patients already on ECMO if they become brain dead. The implementation of OP-ECMO in hemodynamically  unstable brain-dead patients is ethically permissible in certain clinical situations but requires specific consent from relatives if the patient's wish to  donate is not clear. If no evidence of a patient's wish to donate is available, OP-ECMO is not recommended. In countries with presumed consent legislation, failure to opt out should be considered as a positive wish to donate. If a patient is not-yet brain-dead or is undergoing testing for brain death, OP-ECMO is not recommended. Further research on OP-ECMO is needed to better understand the attitudes of professionals, families, and lay people to ensure agreement on key ethical issues.;;Dalle Ave AL, Gardiner D, Shaw DM;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Death', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/*ethics', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Models, Economic', '*Organ Preservation', 'Risk', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Transplantation/*ethics'];['brain death', 'ethics', 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenator', 'organ preservation', 'transplantation'];;;10.1111/tri.12772

However, their analysis of the compatibility of heart donation after circulatory death (DCD) with the dead donor rule (DDR) is flawed. Their permanence-based criteria for death, which depart substantially from established law and bioethics, are ad hoc and unfounded. Furthermore, their analysis is self-defeating, because it undercuts the central motivation for DDR as both a legal and a moral constraint, rendering the DDR vacuous and trivial. Rather than devise new and ad hoc criteria for death for the purpose of rendering DCD nominally consistent with DDR, we contend that the best  approach is to explicitly abandon DDR.;;Nair-Collins M, Miller FG;;eng;['Brain Death/classification/*diagnosis', 'Ethical Theory', 'Heart Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];['*Dead donor rule', '*Definition/Determination of Death', '*Vital organ donation'];;;10.1136/medethics-2016-103464

While overt discrimination has decreased, barriers persist in physician referrals, center-specific decisionmaking regarding wait-listing, and the provision of accommodations for optimizing the assessment and medical management of these individuals. These issues arise from the persistent biases and assumptions of individuals as well as those of a healthcare system that is inadequately positioned to optimally serve the medical needs of the growing number of individuals with functional impairments.

1183;26953218;Article;2016;Chest;;ICU Care Before and After Lung Transplantation.;;Lung transplantation (LTx) has become an accepted treatment for carefully selected patients with end-stage lung disease. Critical care issues have gained importance concerning bridging of candidates by mechanical respiratory support and are involved in the care after transplantation. The nature of respiratory support varies from oxygen supply and noninvasive ventilation, to mechanical respiratory support either by mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal life support. Recent innovations in extracorporeal life support technology have resulted in its more widespread use. Retrospective studies have demonstrated promising outcomes in candidates on mechanical respiratory support as a bridge to lung transplantation. The role of mechanical respiratory support has influenced the selection criteria for LTx, although bridging remains technically and ethically challenging. Critical care is integral to manage and prevent postoperative complications of LTx. Primary graft dysfunction and prolonged mechanical ventilation are major obstacles to hospital survival after LTx. Clear  evidence is lacking on how to ventilate and optimally manage patients after LTx.  Prolonged extracorporeal life support after LTx may improve outcome in selected patients with a primary graft dysfunction.;;Fuehner T, Kuehn C, Welte T, Gottlieb J;;eng;['Critical Care/*methods', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/ethics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Perioperative Care/*methods', 'Postoperative Complications/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Primary Graft Dysfunction/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Respiration, Artificial/ethics/*methods', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*therapy'];['*bridging', '*extracorporeal life support', '*intensive care unit', '*lung transplantation', '*mechanical ventilation'];;;10.1016/j.chest.2016.02.656

The wide-scale application of clinical islet xenotransplantation, however, requires that such a procedure takes place in a specifically and tightly regulated environment. With a view to promoting the safe application of clinical islet xenotransplantation, a few years ago the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) published a Consensus Statement that outlined the key ethical and regulatory requirements to be satisfied before the initiation of xenotransplantation studies in diabetic patients. This earlier IXA Statement also documented a disparate regulatory landscape among different geographical areas. This situation clearly fell short of the 2004 World Health Assembly Resolution WHA57.18 that urged Member States ""to cooperate in the formulation of recommendations and guidelines to harmonize global practices"" to ensure the highest ethical and regulatory standards on a global scale. In this new IXA report, IXA members who are active in xenotransplantation research in their respective geographic areas herewith briefly describe changes in the regulatory frameworks that have taken place in the intervening period in the various geographic areas or countries. The key reassuring take-home message of the present report is that many countries have embraced the encouragement of the WHO to harmonize the procedures in a more global scale. Indeed, important regulatory changes have taken place or are in progress in several geographic areas that include Europe, Korea, Japan, and China. Such significant regulatory changes encompass the most diverse facets of the clinical application of xenotransplantation and comprise ethical aspects, source animals and product specifications, study supervision, sample archiving, patient follow-up and even insurance coverage in some legislations. All these measures are expected to provide a better care and protection of recipients of xenotransplants but also a higher safety profile to xenotransplantation procedures with an ultimate net gain in terms of international public health.";;Cozzi E, Tonjes RR, Gianello P, Buhler LH, Rayat GR, Matsumoto S, Park CG, Kwon I, Wang W, O'Connell P, Jessamine S, Elliott RB, Kobayashi T, Hering BJ;;eng;['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', '*Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/methods', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', 'Swine', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*legislation & jurisprudence/methods'];['national regulatory frameworks', 'type 1 diabetes', 'xenotransplantation'];;;10.1111/xen.12222

We present a systematic review about the published number of patients who purchased organs. With this information, we discuss whether the scientific literature reflects a substantial practice of organ purchase. Between 2000 and 2015, 86 studies were published. Seventy-six of these presented patients who traveled and 42 stated that the transplants were commercial. Only 11 studies reported that patients paid, and eight described to what or whom patients paid. In total, during a period of 42 years, 6002 patients have been reported to travel for transplantation. Of these, only 1238 were reported to have paid for their transplants. An additional unknown number of patients paid for their transplants  in their native countries. We conclude that the scientific literature does not reflect a large number of patients buying organs. Organ purchases were more often assumed than determined.

The overarching aims  of this study are to improve equity of access to kidney and kidney-pancreas transplantation across the UK and to optimise organ allocation to maximise the benefit and cost-effectiveness of transplantation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 6844 patients aged 18-75 years starting dialysis and/or receiving a transplant together with matched patients active on the transplant list from all 72 UK renal units were recruited between November 2011 and March 2013 and will be followed for at least 3 years. The outcomes of interest include patient survival, access to the transplant list, receipt of a transplant, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) including quality of life, treatment satisfaction, well-being and health status on different forms of renal replacement therapy. Sociodemographic and clinical data were prospectively collected from case notes and from interviews with patients and local clinical teams. Qualitative process exploration with clinical staff will help identify unit-specific factors that influence access to renal transplantation. A health economic analysis will explore costs and outcomes associated with alternative approaches to organ allocation. The study will deliver: (1) an understanding of patient and unit-specific factors influencing access to renal transplantation in the UK, informing potential changes to practices and policies to optimise outcomes and reduce intercentre variability; (2) a patient-survival probability model to standardise access to the renal transplant list and (3) an understanding of PROMs and health economic impact of kidney and kidney-pancreas transplantation to inform the development of a more sophisticated and fairer organ allocation algorithm.

These cases raise the question of whether minors who serve as stem cell donors for research subjects should be regarded as research subjects themselves. Regarding pediatric donors as research subjects ensures that an Institutional Review Boards reviews their involvement and determines whether it is appropriate. Yet, Institutional Review Boards must follow the US regulations for pediatric research, which were designed for patients and healthy volunteers, not for healthy donors. As a result, regarding pediatric donors as research subjects also can pose unnecessary obstacles to appropriate and potentially life-saving research. This article considers a new way to address this dilemma. The federal research regulations allow for waiver of some or all of the included requirements when they are unnecessary for a study or a class of studies. We argue that this option offers a way to ensure that the involvement of pediatric donors receives sufficient review and approval without inadvertently undermining valuable and potentially life-saving research.;;Wendler D, Shah NN, Pulsipher MA, Fry T, Grady C;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Biomedical Research/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethics Committees, Research', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Research Subjects', 'Stem Cell Research/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];['*Transplantation', '*donor', '*pediatric', '*regulations'];;Z99 CL999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States;10.1177/1740774515627156

We examine the ethical issues raised by W-LST in the cDCDD context in the light of a review of cDCDD protocols and the ethical literature. Our analysis confirms that W-LST procedures vary considerably among cDCDD centers and that despite existing recommendations, the conflict of interest in the W-LST decision and process might be difficult to avoid, the process of W-LST might interfere with usual end-of-life care, and there is a risk of hastening death. In order to ensure that the practice of W-LST meets already well-established ethical recommendations, we  suggest that W-LST should be managed in the ICU by an ICU physician who has been  part of the W-LST decision. Recommending extubation for W-LST, when this is not necessarily the preferred procedure, is inconsistent with the recommendation to follow usual W-LST protocol. As the risk of conflicts of interest in the decision of W-LST and in the process of W-LST exists, this should be acknowledged and disclosed. Finally, when cDCDD programs interfere with W-LST and end-of-life care, this should be transparently disclosed to the family, and specific informed consent is necessary.;;Dalle Ave AL, Shaw DM;;eng;['Conflict of Interest', 'Decision Making', 'Guideline Adherence/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', '*Intensive Care Units', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Professional-Family Relations/*ethics', '*Terminal Care/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Withholding Treatment/*ethics'];['controlled donation after circulatory determination of death', 'ethics', 'transplantation', 'withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy'];;;10.1177/0885066615625628

The question of donor safety was even more accurate with the occurrence of laparoscopy, a technique which could allegedly increase the risk of severe intraoperative complications. Besides the questions of justice and autonomy, donor safety remains the main ethical debate of LDLT. Considering the lack of comparative assessment of postoperative outcomes, the Jury of the last Consensus  meeting held in Japan in 2014 called for the creation of international registries to help to determine the benefit/risk ratio of laparoscopic donor hepatectomy. Since randomized studies are very unlikely to occur, benchmarking comparisons, between liver and kidney donors for instance, may also help to define standard practice. At last, donors' points of view should also be taken into account in the evaluation of those innovative procedures.;;Soubrane O, Gateau V, Lefeve C;;eng;['Hepatectomy/*ethics/methods', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/*ethics/methods', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics/methods', 'Living Donors/*ethics', '*Registries', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics/methods'];;;;10.1002/jhbp.321

Family members and friends can serve as living donors without offending legal or ethical prohibitions of paid organ donation, even though family members and friends often engage in reciprocal gift exchanges. Donations from living unrelated sources are more problematic, and there is a need to monitor donors' genuine altruism and motivation. Donation by deceased women-i.e. cadaveric donation-raises issues of uterus suitability for transplantation, and how death is diagnosed. Organs' suitability for donation is  often achieved by ventilation to maintain cardiac function for blood circulation, but laws and cultures could deem that a heartbeat indicates donors' live status.  Issues could arise concerning ownership and control of organs between recovery from donors and implantation into recipients, and on removal following childbirth, that require legal resolution.;;Dickens BM;;eng;['46, XX Disorders of Sex Development/*surgery', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*surgery', 'Embryo Transfer/*methods', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Live Birth', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Mullerian Ducts/*abnormalities', 'Pregnancy', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['Altruistic uterus donation', 'Brain death', 'Cadaveric uterus donation', 'Ethics in uterus donation', 'Legality of uterus donation', 'Organ transplantation', 'Uterus donation'];;;10.1016/j.ijgo.2016.01.002

1206;26844716;Article;2016;Professional case management;;Medical Ethics Made Easy.;;PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Case managers (CMs) today are involved in many different care scenarios. They collaborate with many professionals in the multidisciplinary care team. CMs work to facilitate improved patient outcomes and help patients, family  members, and providers establish and work toward similar goals. Often these involve end-of-life and critical care, which can call ethics consultations or utilization of other resources to help facilitate communication toward these goals. The objective of this article was to help increase CMs comfort level with  starting to apply the 4 basic ethical principles to practice in basic concept. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Inpatient acute care as well as outpatient settings, such as physician offices, and home health care settings. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge and a comfort level in applying the 4 ethical principles can help establish the CM role in facilitating communication among care providers, as they work toward a common goal in the treatment plan. Understanding the principles and applying them in basic concept can help CMs participate in conflict resolution or appropriate referrals to ethics committees. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Complex medical situations and care issues can lead to conflicts. Knowledge of basic ethical principles and core concepts may be a useful tool for  CMs as they collaborate and communicate with patients, family members, and health care providers. Facilitating communication about the treatment plan, and acting as patient advocate, can optimize outcomes and potentially reduce length of stay.;;Weise MV;;eng;['Adult', 'Africa, Western/epidemiology', 'Aged', 'Case Management', 'Disease Outbreaks', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Female', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1097/NCM.0000000000000151

This practical manual lists the various criteria to fulfill and the rules and regulations the different stakeholders involved need to comply with to  meet all due diligence requirements. Although an ethicist was involved in writing this paper, this report is not specifically meant to comprehensively address the  ethical issues surrounding the topic. This paper is focused on the operational aspects of the protocol.;;Bollen J, de Jongh W, Hagenaars J, van Dijk G, Ten Hoopen R, Ysebaert D, Ijzermans J, van Heurn E, van Mook W;;eng;['Euthanasia/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Netherlands', 'Organ Transplantation/*standards', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*standards'];['*assisted suicide', '*clinical research / practice', '*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*guidelines', '*law / legislation', '*organ procurement', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*organ transplantation in general', '*patient education', '*physician assisted death'];;;10.1111/ajt.13746

Lives for those not receiving a transplant are likely to be short. One large group of potential recipients needs a new liver because of alcohol consumption, while others suffer for reasons unrelated to their own behaviour. Should the former group receive lower priority when scarce livers are allocated? This discussion connects with one of the most pertinent issues in contemporary political philosophy; the role of personal responsibility in distributive justice. One prominent theory of distributive justice, luck egalitarianism, assesses distributions as just if, and only if, people's relative positions reflect their exercises of responsibility. There is a principled luck egalitarian case for giving lower priority to those who are responsible for their need. Compared to the existing literature favouring such differentiation, luck egalitarianism provides a clearer rationale of fairness, acknowledges the need for individual assessments of responsibility, and requires initiatives both inside and outside of the allocation systems aimed at mitigating the influence from social circumstances. Furthermore, the concrete policies that luck egalitarians can recommend are neither too harsh on those who make imprudent choices nor excessively intrusive towards those whose exercises of responsibility are assessed.";;Albertsen A;;eng;['Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Resource Allocation/methods', 'Social Responsibility', '*Waiting Lists'];['Distributive justice', 'Health inequalities', 'Liver transplantation', 'Luck egalitarianism', 'MELD', 'Medical ethics', 'Organ allocation', 'Organ shortage', 'Organ transplant waiting list', 'Organ waiting list', 'Personal responsibility', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting list'];;;10.1007/s11019-016-9684-7
1211;26833553;Article;2016;Bioethics;;Should Deceased Donation be Morally Preferred in Uterine Transplantation Trials?;;In recent years much research has been undertaken regarding the feasibility of the human uterine transplant (UTx) as a treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI). Should it reach clinical application this procedure would allow such individuals what is often a much-desired opportunity to become not only social mothers (via adoption or traditional surrogacy arrangements), or genetic and social mothers (through gestational surrogacy) but mothers in a social, genetic and gestational sense. Like many experimental transplantation procedures such as face, hand, corneal and larynx transplants, UTx as a therapeutic option falls firmly into the camp of the quality of life (QOL) transplant, undertaken with the aim, not to save a life, but to enrich one. However, unlike most of these novel procedures - where one would be unlikely to find a willing living donor or an ethics committee that would sanction such a donation - the organs to be transplanted in UTx are potentially available from both living and deceased donors. In this article, in the light of the recent nine-case research trial in Sweden which used uteri obtained from living donors,  and the assertions on the part of a number of other research teams currently preparing trials that they will only be using deceased donors, I explore the question of whether, in the case of UTx, there exist compelling moral reasons to  prefer the use of deceased donors despite the benefits that may be associated with the use of organs obtained from the living.;;Williams N;;eng;['Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*surgery/*therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Quality of Life', 'Sweden', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['*autonomy', '*beneficence', '*non-maleficence', '*quality of life transplants', '*reproductive ethics', '*transplantation ethics', '*uterine transplants'];;097897/Z/11/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom;10.1111/bioe.12247
1212;26830897;Article;2016;Der Nervenarzt;;[Non-heart-beating donors are ineligible].;;The death of the donor is a mandatory prerequisite for organ transplantation (dead donor rule) worldwide. It is a medical, legal and ethical consensus to accept the concept of brain death, as first proposed in 1968 by the ad hoc committee of the Harvard Medical School, as a certain criterion of death. In isolated cases where the diagnosis of brain death was claimed to be wrong, it could be demonstrated that the diagnostic procedure for brain death had not been  correctly performed. In March 2014 a joint statement by the German neuromedical societies emphasized that 1) the diagnosis of brain death is one of the safest diagnoses in medicine if performed according to accepted medical standards and criteria and 2) the concept of non-heart-beating donors (NHBD, i. e. organ donation after an arbitrarily defined duration of circulatory and cardiac arrest) practiced in some European countries must be absolutely rejected because it implicates a high risk of diagnostic error. According to the current literature it is unclear at what time cardiac and circulatory arrest is irreversible and leads to irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain including the brainstem, even though clinical signs of cessation of brain functions are always found after 10 min. Furthermore, is it often an arbitrary decision to exactly define the duration of cardiac arrest if continuous echocardiographic monitoring has not been carried out from the very beginning. Last but not least there are ethical concerns against the concept of NHBD because it might influence therapeutic efforts to resuscitate a patient with cardiac arrest. Therefore, the  German Medical Council (BAK) has repeatedly rejected the concept of NHBD for organ transplantation since 1995.;;Heide W;;ger;['Brain Death/classification/*diagnosis/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Cardiology/standards', 'Critical Care/standards', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Cardiovascular/*standards', 'Diagnostic Techniques, Neurological/ethics/standards', 'Eligibility Determination/*standards', 'Germany', 'Heart Arrest/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Internal Medicine/standards', 'Neurology/standards', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*standards'];['Brain death', 'Cardiac arrest', 'Dead donor rule', 'Determination of death', 'Organ transplantation'];;;10.1007/s00115-015-0048-y

The number of potential organ donors in 1999 was the lowest in Europe with only 10 donors per million inhabitants. Medical associations, public health services, health insurance companies and the government had to find common solutions in order to improve organ allocation, logistics of donations and to increase the number of transplantations. After a prolonged debate on medical ethical issues of organ transplantation, all participants were able to agree on socio-medico-legal regulations for organ donation and transplantation. In addition to improving the  procedure for organ donation after brain death (DBD) the most important step was  the introduction of organ donation after circulatory death (DCD). Measures such as the introduction of a national organ donor database, improved information to the public, further education on intensive care units (ICU), guidelines for end of life care on the ICU, establishment of transplantation coordinators on site, introduction of autonomous explantation teams and strict procedures on the course of organ donations, answered many practical issues about logistics and responsibilities for DBD and DCD. In 2014 the number of postmortem organ donations rose to 16.4 per million inhabitants. Meanwhile, up to 60 % of organ donations in the Netherlands originate from a DCD procedure compared to approximately 10 % in the USA.

OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: We rigorously analyse whether four heart DCDD programmes (Cape Town, Denver, Australia, Cambridge) respect the dead donor rule (DDR), according to six criteria of death: irreversible cessation of all bodily cells function (or organs), irreversible cessation of heart function, irreversible cessation of circulation, permanent cessation of circulation, irreversible cessation of brain  function and permanent cessation of brain function. CONCLUSIONS: Only death criteria based on permanency are compatible with the DDR under two conditions: (1) a minimum stand-off period of 5 min to ensure that autoresuscitation is impossible and that all brain functions have been lost and (2) no medical intervention is undertaken that might resume bodily or brain circulation. By our  analysis, only the Australia heart DCDD programme using a stand-off period of 5 min respects the DDR when the criteria of death are based on permanency.;;Dalle Ave AL, Shaw D, Bernat JL;;eng;['Australia/epidemiology', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Brain/blood supply', 'Brain Death/*diagnosis', '*Heart', '*Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Tissue Donors/classification/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/methods', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology'];['*Dead donor rule', '*Donation/Procurement of Organs/Tissues', '*Hearts'];;;10.1136/medethics-2015-103224

Because of the inadequate infrastructure for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, coupled with the challenges of logistics for maintenance dialysis, transplantation would seem to be the best option for patients with end-stage renal failure, even in developed economies where these can easily be tackled. The main issues here revolve around  incentives for donors, organ trade and trafficking and the economics of eliminating the waiting list and the criminal activities of organ trans-plantation. In the developing world, with the current level of corruption and poverty, there is a need to redouble efforts to monitor transplant activities. Professional bodies should take the lead in this regard.

We aimed to validate this gender inequality in a large pediatric population and to investigate its causes. This cohort study included 6454 patients starting renal replacement therapy before 18 years old, in 35 countries participating in the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry. We used cumulative incidence competing risk and proportional hazards frailty models to study the time to receive a transplant and hierarchical logistic regression to investigate access to preemptive transplantation. Girls had a slower access to renal transplantation because of a 23% lower probability of receiving preemptive  transplantation. We found a longer follow-up time before renal replacement therapy in boys compared with girls despite a similar estimated glomerular filtration rate at first appointment. Girls tend to progress faster toward end-stage renal disease than boys, which may contribute to a shorter time available for pretransplantation workup. Overall, medical factors explained only  70% of the gender difference. In Europe, girls have less access to preemptive transplantation for reasons that are only partially related to medical factors. Nonmedical factors such as patient motivation and parent and physician attitudes  toward transplantation and organ donation may contribute to this inequality. Our  study should raise awareness for the management of girls with renal diseases.;;Hogan J, Couchoud C, Bonthuis M, Groothoff JW, Jager KJ, Schaefer F, Van Stralen KJ;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Services Accessibility', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Factors'];['*clinical research/practice', '*ethics and public policy', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*pediatrics', '*recipient selection', '*registry/registry analysis'];;;10.1111/ajt.13723

The economic impact of redistricting was evaluated with two distinct data sources, Medicare claims and the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC). We estimated total Medicare payments under (i) the current allocation system (Share 35), (ii) full regional sharing, (iii) an eight-district plan, and (iv) a four-district plan for a simulated population of patients listed for liver transplant over 5 years, using  the liver simulated allocation model. The model predicted 5-year transplant volumes (Share 35, 29,267; regional sharing, 29,005; eight districts, 29,034; four districts, 28,265) and a reduction in overall mortality, including listed and posttransplant patients, of up to 676 lives. Compared with current allocation, the eight-district plan was estimated to reduce payments for pretransplant care ($1638 million to $1506 million, p < 0.001), transplant episode ($5607 million to $5569 million, p < 0.03) and posttransplant care ($479  million to $488 million, p < 0.001). The eight-district plan was estimated to increase per-patient transportation costs for organs ($8988 to $11,874 per patient, p < 0.001) and UHC estimated hospital costs ($4699 per case).

Prior studies indicate that low-performance (LP) center evaluations by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) are associated with reductions in transplant volume. There is limited information to determine whether performance oversight impacts waitlist management. We used national SRTR  data to evaluate outcomes of 315 796 candidates on the kidney transplant waiting  list (2007-2014). Compared to centers without LP, rates of waitlist removal (WLR) were higher at centers with LP evaluations (44.6/1000 follow-up years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 44.0, 45.1 versus 68.0/1000 follow-up years, 95% CI 66.6, 69.4), respectively, which was consistent after risk adjustment (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.59, 95% CI 1.55, 1.63). Candidate mortality following waitlist removal was lower at LP centers (AHR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.87, 0.94). Analyses limited to LP centers indicated a significant increase in WLR (+28.6 removals/1000 follow-up years, p < 0.001), a decrease in transplant rates (-11.9/1000 follow-up years, p < 0.001) and a decrease in mortality after removal (-67.5 deaths/1000 follow-up years, p < 0.001) following LP evaluation.

Materials and Methods The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Thirteen healthy kidney donors and their corresponding recipients underwent kidney BOLD MR imaging with a 3-T imager. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. BOLD  MR imaging was performed in donors before uninephrectomy and in donors and recipients 8 days, 3 months, and 12 months after transplantation. R2* values, which are inversely related to tissue partial pressure of oxygen, were determined in the cortex and medulla. Longitudinal R2* changes were statistically analyzed by using repeated measures one-way analysis of variance with post hoc pair-wise comparisons. Results R2* values in the remaining kidneys significantly decreased  early after uninephrectomy in both the medulla and cortex (P < .003), from 28.9 sec(-1) +/- 2.3 to 26.4 sec(-1) +/- 2.5 in the medulla and from 18.3 sec(-1) +/-  1.5 to 16.3 sec(-1) +/- 1.0 in the cortex, indicating increased oxygen content. In donors, R2* remained significantly decreased in both the medulla and cortex at 3 (P < .01) and 12 (P < .01) months. In transplanted kidneys, R2* remained stable during the first year after transplantation, with no significant change. Among donors, cortical R2* was found to be negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (R = -0.47, P < .001). Conclusion The results suggest  that BOLD MR imaging may potentially be used to monitor renal functional changes  in both remaining and corresponding transplanted kidneys.

This scoping review was performed to map the pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death literature, identify pediatric donation after circulatory  determination of death knowledge gaps, and inform the development of national or  regional pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death guidelines.  DATA SOURCES: Terms related to pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death were searched in Embase and MEDLINE, as well as the non-MEDLINE sources  in PubMed from 1980 to May 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Seven thousand five hundred ninety-seven references were discovered and 85 retained for analysis. All references addressing pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death were considered. Exclusion criteria were articles that did not address pediatric  patients, animal or laboratory studies, surgical techniques, and local pediatric  donation after circulatory determination of death protocols. Narrative reviews and opinion articles were the most frequently discovered reference (25/85) and the few discovered studies were observational or qualitative and almost exclusively retrospective. DATA EXTRACTION: Retained references were divided into themes and analyzed using qualitative methodology. DATA SYNTHESIS: The main discovered themes were 1) studies estimating the number of potential pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death donors and their impact on donation; 2) ethical issues in pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death; 3) physiology of the dying process after withdrawal of life-sustaining  therapy; 4) cardiac pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death;  and 5) neonatal pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death. Donor estimates suggest that pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death will remain an event less common than brain death, albeit with the potential to substantially expand the existing organ donation pool. Limited data  suggest outcomes comparable with organs donated after neurologic determination of death. Although there is continued debate around ethical aspects of pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death, all pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death publications from professional societies contend that pediatric donation after circulatory determination of death can be practiced ethically.

This paper aims to analyze the outcomes of this protocol. 89 candidates have been examined for the performance of 23 living donor liver transplantations. The procedure was successfully completed by 25 candidates (28.1%), including two cases of procedure suspension due to occurrence of a suitable deceased donor. The majority of exclusions occurred in the third phase, generally due to anatomical variations: arterial (17%), portal (9.68%), venous (18.15%) and biliary (18.15%), and for several reasons simultaneously (6.7%). NO exclusions occurred due to inadequate potential graft or residual volume. All living donors underwent left lateral resection and  the measured volumes were enough for both the recipients and the donors. No significant complications occurred in the donors (Clavien 1: 21%, Clavien II: 4%), with no need of transfusion, reoperation or re-hospitalization. The laboratory parameters were restored to normal values within the 10th postoperative day as the average hospital stay was 14.7 days. All donors were discharged with normal laboratory, instrumental and physical parameters. No abnormalities were observed at long-term follow-up. No primary graft dysfunction  was observed. The large proportion of declined candidates requires strict adherence to the precise sequence of the evaluation protocol. The main reasons for decline are anatomical variation. Los level of complicatons was registered, with short postoperative stay, normal laboratory results at discharge and normal  physiological parameters at long-term follow-up. The concept of donor advocate was introduced for the first time in Bulgaria. His task is to defend the interests of the candidate donor and to provide assistance in making an informed  decision.;;Pashev V, Naychov Z, Uzunova J, Spasov L;;bul;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bulgaria/epidemiology', 'Child', '*Donor Selection/economics/ethics/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver/anatomy & histology/diagnostic imaging/*surgery', '*Liver Transplantation/methods', '*Living Donors', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Postoperative Period', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult'];;;;

1231;26710038;Article;2016;Plastic and reconstructive surgery;;A Methodology for Determining Standard of Care Status for a New Surgical Procedure: Hand Transplantation.;;BACKGROUND: Hand allotransplantation was initially criticized as unethical and unlikely to succeed. The results proved to be better than anticipated, now raising the issue of whether hand transplantation is the standard of care. The purpose of this article is to outline a reasonable methodology for determining whether a surgical procedure is the standard of care, and then to apply that methodology to hand transplantation. METHODS: Publications on ethics and definitions of medical (not legal) standard of care were reviewed. All hand transplantations completed in the United States were evaluated regarding their status as experimental, standard of care, or both. Then, the stakeholders, physicians, public insurers, and regulators were examined to determine whether they accepted hand transplantation as the standard of care. Utility and incremental cost-utility ratio were determined. Hand transplantation was considered the standard of care when stakeholders were using, insuring, and regulating the procedure. RESULTS: The public expresses a desire for hand transplantation. A minority of surgeons consider the procedure the standard of care. Ethical committees, institutional review boards, and scholarly articles deem the procedure ethical. A series of institutions have carried out the procedure with a record of successes. Some institutions perform the surgical procedure as the standard of care. Scholarly work demonstrates beneficial outcomes. Some commercial and federal government insurers are willing to cover the cost of the procedure. Utility determination justifies the procedure. There are no incremental cost-utility ratio analysis studies that justify the procedure. CONCLUSION: Hand transplantation is moving from acceptance as an ethical surgical experiment to the standard of care.;;Breidenbach WC, Meister EA, Turker T, Becker GW, Gorantla VS, Levin LS;;eng;['Allografts', 'Hand Injuries/*surgery', 'Hand Transplantation/*standards', 'Humans', 'Standard of Care/*organization & administration', '*Surgeons'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0000000000001892

The inclusion of these often financially and/or socially privileged patients in the pool of potential candidates for an absolutely scarce and life-saving liver transplant may exacerbate disparities already existing in deceased donor liver allocation. In addition, their inclusion on organ transplant waiting lists conflicts with recognized ethical principles of justice and reciprocity. Moreover, preliminary data suggest that public awareness of this practice could discourage organ donation, thereby worsening an already profound supply-demand gulf. Finally, U.S. organ allocation policies and statutes are out of step with recently promulgated  international transplant guidelines, which prioritize self-sufficiency of organ programs. This article analyzes each of these ethical conflicts within the context of deceased donor liver transplantation and recommends policy changes that align the United States with international practices that discourage this scenario.;;Hartsock JA, Ivy SS, Helft PR;;eng;['Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', '*Patient Selection', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'United States', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1111/ajt.13674

Experts in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, transplantation, social work, ethics, and transplant administration met and reviewed center experiences and literature. The attendees highlighted the importance and the complexity of the psychiatric assessment in this field of transplantation. Moreover, the necessity  to develop common instruments and evaluation protocols to predict psychosocial outcomes as well as to understand whether we are transplanting the right patients and how the transplantation is affecting the patients were pointed out. Psychiatric complications in upper extremity transplanted patients have been reported by the majority of teams. Preexisting psychiatric difficulties, the initial trauma of amputation, or adjusting to the transplantation process itself  (especially the medical follow-up and rehabilitation process) appeared to be important factors. Monitoring during the whole follow-up was recommended to detect psychiatric issues and to facilitate and ensure long-term adherence.

This has opened the door for illegal organ trade and trafficking including from children. Organized crime groups and individual organ  brokers exploit the situation and, as a result, black markets are becoming more numerous and organized organ trafficking is expanding worldwide. While underprivileged and vulnerable men and women in developing countries are a major  source of trafficked organs, and may themselves be trafficked for the purpose of  illegal organ removal and trade, children are at especial risk of exploitation. With the confirmed cases of children being trafficked for their organs, child organ trafficking, which once called a ""modern urban legend"", is a sad reality in today's world. By presenting a global picture of child organ trafficking, this paper emphasizes that child organ trafficking is no longer a myth but a reality which has to be addressed. It argues that the international efforts against organ trafficking and trafficking in human beings for organ removal have failed to address child organ trafficking adequately.

METHODS: The Declaration of Istanbul  Custodian Group convened an international working group to evaluate the possible  role of extraterritorial jurisdiction in strengthening the enforcement of existing laws governing transplant-related crimes across national boundaries. Potential practical and ethical concerns about the use of extraterritorial jurisdiction were examined, and possible responses were explored. RESULTS: Extraterritorial jurisdiction is a legitimate tool to combat transplant-related crimes. Further, development of a global registry of transnational transplant activities in conjunction with a standardized international referral system for legitimate travel for transplantation is proposed as a mechanism to support enforcement of national and international legal tools. CONCLUSIONS: States are encouraged to include provisions on extraterritorial jurisdiction in their laws on transplant-related crimes and to collaborate with professionals and international authorities in the development of a global registry of transnational transplant activities.

We then identify all transplant related ethics consults performed at the Cleveland Clinic (CC) between 2008 and 2013 in order to identify how consultants conceptually framed their consultations by the domains they ascribe to the case. We code the CC domains to those in the Core Competencies for Healthcare Consultation Ethics in order to initiate a broader conversation regarding best practices in these highly complex cases. A discussion of the ethical issues underlying living donor  and recipient related consults ensues. Finally, we suggest that the ethical domains prescribed in the Core Competencies provide a strong starting ground for  a common intra-disciplinary language in the realm of formal CEC.;;Shafran D, Smith ML, Daly BJ, Goldfarb D;;eng;['Communication', '*Ethics Consultation', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics'];['Donor', 'Ethics consultation', 'Informed consent', 'Recipient', 'Transplant'];;;10.1007/s10730-015-9285-5

A priori and empirical investigation concludes that such systems are ethically inadequate. A new methodological approach towards policy formation and implementation is proposed which places ethical concerns at its core. From a hypothetical secular origin, the optimal ethical policy structure concerning organ donation is derived. However, when applied universally, it does not yield ideal results for every culture and society due to region-specific variation. Since religion holds significant influence in the organ donation debate, three religions-Catholicism,  Islam, and Shinto-were examined in order to illustrate this variation. Although secular ethical concerns should rest at the core of policy construction, certain  region-specific contexts require cultural and religious competence and necessitate the adjustment of the optimal template policy accordingly to yield the best moral and practical results.;;Smith HJ;;eng;['Commerce/*ethics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Policy', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', '*Religion', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/*ethics'];['Moral theory', 'Organ transplantation', 'Policy methodology', 'Public health ethics', 'Religious studies'];;;10.1007/s11019-015-9632-y

This article challenges the latter and argues that ""social death"" evident in severe face, hand, and larynx disfigurement can be potentially treated via VCA. Social death (from a social science perspective) consists of a combination of 7 components: social isolation, loneliness, ostracism, loss of personhood, change of role and identity, harm, and disfigurement. Methods: In February 2016, PubMed and Google were searched for case reports of human face, hand, and larynx transplantation. Patient and team narratives were then coded for components of social death using social science and medical model criteria. Results: Eleven narratives were identified among 9 articles. The social science model (but not the medical model) described pretransplant social death and the resolution of social death by receiving VCA. Notably, the medical model of social death was deemed unsuitable for application to VCA. This is because case narratives consistently contradict elements of the medical model. Conclusions: By including social death as a patient inclusion criterion for face, hand, and larynx VCA, these transplants can be considered lifesaving. Additionally, because VCA requires lifelong immunosuppressant medication, considering VCA as a lifesaving intervention improves the technology's risk-benefit analysis. Guidance for assessing social death is provided.";;Bramstedt KA;;eng;;['ethics consultation', 'narrative', 'quality of life', 'social death', 'social isolation', 'vascularized composite allotransplantation'];Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.;;10.1177/2374373517730556
1242;29460799;Article;2018;Clinical nutrition ESPEN;;Customized nutrition intervention and personalized counseling helps achieve nutrition targets in perioperative liver transplant patients.;;BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nutritional therapy is an integral part of care in all phases of liver transplantation (LTx). However, there are several factors that make it a challenge to manage malnutrition in these patients including, but not limited to, loss of appetite, dietary restrictions and dietary habits. Dietary habits are guided by personal choice, social, cultural and regional background with diversity ranging from veganism to vegetarianism with the latter predominant in Indian population. Therefore, it is difficult to improve nutritional intake of patients with standard dietary recommendations. We evaluated the effects of implementing personalized dietary counseling and a customized nutrition plan on its ability to enhance oral intake and, thereby improve nutritional status of patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD) being evaluated for LTx. We compared the outcomes with a matched group of patients who were prescribed standard dietary recommendations from a historic database. Primary outcome was measured by number of patients achieving >/=75% of recommended energy and protein requirements during hospitalization for LTx. Secondary outcomes included mean energy and protein intake, hours of ventilation, length of stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital, mortality and readmission rate in the acute phase (3months) after LTx. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, performed at a single LTx centre. All patients >18years who enrolled for LTx and  consented for the study were included. The study was conducted after obtaining institutional ethics committee approval. A protocol based nutrition planning was  implemented from April'14. According to this protocol, all patients being evaluated for LTx underwent a detailed nutritional assessment by a qualified Clinical Dietitian (CD) and regularly followed up with until LTx. Nutritional intervention, including a customized nutrition care plan and personalized dietary counseling, was provided based on the severity of malnutrition. To evaluate the efficacy of this protocol, we compared the nutritional adequacy (calorie and protein intake) of 65 consecutive patients who underwent LTx between August'14-October'15 (group 1) with a historic database of 65 patients who underwent LTx between January'13 and April'14 (group 2). Patients' demographics,  disease severity score, baseline markers of nutritional status (subjective global assessment (SGA), and body mass index (BMI)), were recorded. First, assessment of individual patient's oral energy and protein intake was determined by the daily calorie count during hospitalization. Then the nutritional intervention (oral nutrition supplement (ONS)/enteral nutrition (EN)/parenteral nutrition (PN)) plan was customized according to their spontaneous oral intake. As part of the protocol, health related quality of life was also assessed using short form 8 (SF-8) in group 1. Statistical analyses using Pearson's correlation, Chi-Square test were applied with SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: The mean age of group 1 and 2  were 52.6 +/- 9.8, 51.9 +/- 10.5 (range 25-70years) with BMI of 26.8 +/- 6.0, 26.5 +/- 5.4 respectively. According to SGA, there was significant improvement in the nutritional status of group 1 patients compared to group 2 on admission for LTx. It was indicated that 88% of group 1 individuals in comparison to 98% in group 2 were malnourished. The calorie intake of group 1 (1740.2 +/- 254.8) was significantly higher than group 2 (1568.5 +/- 321.6) (p = 0.005). The marked improvement in protein intake in group 1 (63.1 +/- 12.1) when compared with group 2 (53.1 +/- 13.4) was statistically significant (p = 0.008). A subset analysis showed that non-vegetarians (consuming meat and dairy products) between the groups showed that group 1 had a significantly higher calorie (p = 0.004) and protein (p = 0.0001) intake compared to individuals in group 2. Following implementation of study's protocol, the goal of achieving >/=75% of the prescribed calories (p = 0.013) and protein (p = 0.0001) was significantly higher in group 1. CONCLUSION: When compared to the standard prescription, an individualized protocol to diagnose, stratify the severity of malnutrition early, and follow up by customized nutrition planning for patients helped to achieve nutritional targets more effectively. Inspite of patients' diversity in nutritional habits and reluctance to accept change, it is clear that a qualified  and dedicated transplant nutrition team can successfully implement perioperative  nutrition protocol to achieve better nutritional targets.;;Daphnee DK, John S, Rajalakshmi P, Vaidya A, Khakhar A, Bhuvaneshwari S, Ramamurthy A;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Body Mass Index', '*Counseling', '*Diet', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'India', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length of Stay', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutritional Requirements', 'Nutritional Support', '*Perioperative Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult'];['*Customized nutrition intervention', '*Dietary habits', '*Nutrition targets', '*Perioperative liver transplant patients', '*Personalized counselling'];;;10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.09.014

There is some evidence that permitting doctors and nurses to register objections can ultimately lead to attitudinal change and acceptance of organ donation. However, while there may be grounds for conscientious objection in other cases such as abortion and euthanasia, the life-saving nature of donation and transplantation renders objection in this context more difficult to  justify.

Indeed, with respect to precedent autonomy and surviving investment interests, the brain-dead are morally equivalent to patients with severe dementia, and thus can be harmed and wronged if and only if, and to the extent that, patients with severe dementia can.

However, the use of organs from marginal and non-standard risk donors poses considerable ethical issues. The acceptability of the risk/benefit ratio depends primarily on  a clinical assessment, and information given to the recipient and his/her eventual consent are crucial. Some of the requisites concerning information and consent are mandatory. Once these requisites have been defined in binding regulations, adequate margins must be allowed for their personalisation and to account for the unique nature of each physician/patient relationship.

1247;29254606;Article;2018;Surgery;;An academic career in global surgery: a position paper from the Society of University Surgeons Committee on Academic Global Surgery.;;In recent years, as the high burden of surgical disease and poor access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries have gained recognition as major public health problems, interest in global health has surged among surgical trainees and faculty. Traditionally, clinical volunteerism was at the forefront of the high-income country response to the significant burden of surgical disease in low- and middle-income countries. However, sustainable strategies for providing surgical care in low- and middle-income countries increasingly depend on bilateral clinical, research, and education collaborations to ensure effective resource allocation and contextual relevance. Academic global surgery creates avenues for interested surgeons to combine scholarship and education with their clinical global surgery passions through incorporation of basic/translational, education, clinical outcomes, or health services research with global surgery. Training in global health, either within residency or through advanced degrees, can provide the necessary skills to develop and sustain such initiatives. We further propose that creating cross-continental, bidirectional collaborations can maximize funding opportunities. Academic institutions are uniquely positioned to  lead longitudinal and, importantly, sustainable global surgery efforts. However,  for the individual global surgeon, the career path forward may be unclear. This paper reviews the development of academic global surgery, delineates the framework and factors critical to training global surgeons, and proposes models for establishing an academic career in this field.

Heart failure;;Trends in the Use of Inotropes to List Adult Heart Transplant Candidates at Status 1A.;;"BACKGROUND: The number of adult heart transplant candidates waiting at the most urgent status 1A has increased over time despite the expansion of geographic sharing of hearts in 2006. We aimed to determine whether candidates listed with inotropes contribute to the excess status 1A candidates. METHODS AND RESULTS: The initial registrations of all adult heart-only candidates listed from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data set. Trends in listing status, justifications, and candidate factors were measured. Adjusted trends in listing status pre- and post-geographic sharing were estimated using multilevel logistic regression. Competing risks models provided trends in transplant-free waitlist survival. There were 46 853 adult heart-alone listings during 2000 to 2015. Pre-sharing, status 1A listing was unchanged over time (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.23). Post-sharing, the adjusted odds of status 1A listing increased 117% over 9 years (adjusted odds ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval, 1.82-2.58). The number of candidates listed  as status 1A with inotropes increased by 193 a year, whereas the dobutamine, dopamine, and milrinone doses used decreased 49%, 55%, and 29% (P<0.001). The risk of waitlist death or deterioration of status 1A inotrope candidates relative to status 2 candidates decreased 62% for 2006 to 2010 and 70% for 2011 to 2015 compared with that for 2003 to 2006. CONCLUSIONS: After the wider geographic sharing of hearts in 2006, transplant programs used multiple inotropes to list candidates at status 1A more frequently with progressively lower doses. Concurrently, the status 1A inotrope candidate waitlist outcomes improved substantially. These trends suggest that overtreatment with multiple inotropes contributes to the current critical excess of status 1A candidates.";;Parker WF, Garrity ER Jr, Fedson S, Churpek MM;;eng;['Adult', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Failure/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Heart Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*trends', '*Transplant Recipients', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Waiting Lists/*mortality'];['adult', 'dobutamine', 'ethics', 'heart', 'policy', 'transplantation'];;K08 HL121080/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004483
1249;29228447;Article;2017;European review for medical and pharmacological sciences;;Ethical and medico-legal remarks on uterus transplantation: may it solve uterine  factor infertility?;;Uterus transplantation was firstly tested with animal trials sixty-five years ago. Despite several successful attempts in human subjects, the different procedures still lay at the experimental stage, in need of further studies and investigations before they can be considered as standard clinical practices. Uterus transplant cannot be regarded as a life-saving procedure, but rather a method to restore woman ability to procreate, when lost, thus improving her quality of life. Uterus transplant is a complex surgical procedure and presents significant health threats. Medical staff should therefore always obtain informed consent from patients, emphasizing such risks. Before that, women undergoing uterine transplants should be thoroughly informed about the hazards inherent to the procedure and especially about the dangers of immunosuppressant drugs, administered after the surgery which may injure the fetus, eventually formed in the restored organ and even lead to its death, thus nullifying the purpose of the transplant itself. Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio of uterus transplantation needs to be carefully assessed and described.;;Zaami S, Marinelli E, di Luca NM, Montanari Vergallo G;;eng;['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*surgery', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Uterine Diseases/*surgery', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];;;;10.26355/eurrev_201711_13854
1250;29216883;Article;2017;BMC medical ethics;;Transplant eligibility for patients with affective and psychotic disorders: a review of practices and a call for justice.;;BACKGROUND: The scarcity of human organs requires the transplant community to make difficult allocation decisions. This process begins at individual medical centers, where transplant teams decide which patients to place on the transplant  waiting list. Each transplant center utilizes its own listing criteria to determine if a patient is eligible for transplantation. These criteria have historically considered preexisting affective and psychotic disorders to be relative or absolute contraindications to transplantation. While attitudes within the field appear to be moving away from this practice, there is no data to confirm that eligibility criteria have changed. MAIN BODY: There are no nationwide guidelines detailing the manner in which affective and psychotic disorders should impact transplant eligibility. Individual transplant centers thus form their own transplant eligibility criteria, resulting in significant inter-institution variability. Data from the 1990s indicates that the majority of transplant programs considered certain psychiatric illnesses, such as active schizophrenia, to be absolute contraindications to transplantation. A review of literature reveals that no comprehensive data has been collected on the topic since that time. Furthermore, the limited data available about current practices  suggests that psychiatric illness continues to be viewed as a contraindication to transplantation at some transplant centers. In light of this finding, we review psychiatric literature that examines the impact of affective and psychotic disorders on transplant outcomes and conclude that the presence of these disorders is not an accurate predictor of transplant success. We then discuss the requirements of justice as they relate to the creation of a just organ allocation system. CONCLUSION: We conclude that transplant eligibility criteria that exclude patients with affective and psychotic disorders on the basis of their psychiatric diagnosis alone are unjust. Just listing criteria must incorporate only those factors that have a causative effect on posttransplant morbidity and mortality. Justice also demands that we eliminate current inter-institution practice variations in favor of national transplant eligibility criteria. Given the limited data available about current practices, we call for an updated study investigating the manner in which affect and psychotic disorders impact transplant eligibility determinations.;;Cahn-Fuller KL, Parent B;;eng;['Eligibility Determination/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', '*Psychotic Disorders', 'Social Justice', 'United States', 'Waiting Lists'];['Organ transplantation', 'Psychiatric illness', 'Psychosocial evaluation', 'Transplant candidates', 'Transplant eligibility'];;;10.1186/s12910-017-0235-4

These organs carry a greater risk of initial dysfunction and early failure, as well as inferior long-term outcomes. As such, many are rejected due to a perceived risk of use and use varies widely between centres. Ex situ normothermic machine perfusion of the liver (NMP-L) may enable the safe transplantation of organs that meet defined objective criteria denoting their high-risk status and are currently being declined for use by all the UK transplant centres. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Viability testing and transplantation of marginal livers is an open-label, non-randomised, prospective, single-arm trial designed to determine whether currently unused donor livers can be salvaged and safely transplanted with equivalent outcomes in terms of patient survival. The procured rejected livers must meet predefined criteria that objectively denote their marginal condition. The liver is subjected to NMP-L following a period of static cold storage. Organs metabolising lactate to </=2.5 mmol/L within 4 hours of the perfusion commencing in combination with two or more of the following parameters-bile production, metabolism of glucose, a hepatic arterial flow rate >/=150 mL/min and a portal venous flow rate >/=500 mL/min, a pH >/=7.30 and/or maintain a homogeneous perfusion-will be considered viable and transplanted into a suitable consented recipient. The coprimary outcome measures  are the success rate of NMP-L to produce a transplantable organ and 90-day patient post-transplant survival.

Despite this policy, some donors and recipients express the desire to know one another. Little empirical evidence informs the debate on anonymity. This study explored the experiences, preferences, and attitudes of donors and recipients toward anonymity. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational multicenter study using both qualitative and quantitative methods. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 414 participants from Dutch and Swedish transplantation centers who received or donated a kidney anonymously (nondirected or paired exchange) completed a questionnaire about anonymity. Participation was a median of 31 months after surgery. FACTORS: Country of residence, donor/recipient status, transplant type, time since surgery. OUTCOMES: Experiences, preferences, and attitudes toward anonymity. RESULTS: Most participants were satisfied with their experience of anonymity before and after surgery. A minority would have liked to have met the other party before (donors, 7%; recipients, 15%) or after (donors, 22%; recipients, 31%) surgery. Significantly more recipients than donors wanted to meet the other party. Most study participants were open to meeting the other party if the desire was mutual (donors, 58%; recipients, 60%). Donors agree significantly more with the principle of anonymity before and after surgery than recipients. Donors and recipients thought that if both parties agreed, it should be permissible to meet  before or after surgery. There were few associations between country or time since surgery and experiences or attitudes. The pros and cons of anonymity reported by participants were clustered into relational and emotional, ethical, and practical and logistical domains. LIMITATIONS: The relatively low response rate of recipients may have reduced generalizability. Recall bias was possible given the time lag between transplantation and data collection. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study illustrated that although donors and recipients were usually satisfied with anonymity, the majority viewed a strict policy on anonymity as unnecessary.

METHODS: Participants were 275 outpatients who received liver transplantation. A structured self-report questionnaire was used to assess health care providers' autonomy support, transplant-related characteristics, illness consequence perception, autonomy, competence, family relatedness, depression and self-management. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS/WIN 24.0 and AMOS 24.0 program. RESULTS: The modified model showed a good fitness with the data: GFI=.96, RMSEA=.06, CFI=.96, NFI=.93, TLI=.93, PGFI=.43, PNFI=.49. The health care providers' autonomy support, competence, family relatedness and depression were factors with a direct influence on the self-management of liver transplant recipients. The health care providers' autonomy support and illness consequence perception had an indirect influence through competence, family relatedness and depression. However, the transplant-related characteristics and autonomy did not have a significant effect on self-management. This model explained 59.4% of the variance in self-management. CONCLUSION: The result suggests that continuous education must be done to promote the competence of liver transplant recipients and to encourage the patient to positively perceive their current health condition with a view that enhances one's self-management. Additionally, the liver transplant recipients should be screened for depression, which would affect self-management. Most of all, health care providers, who have the most influence on self-management, should improve therapeutic communication and try to form a therapeutic relationship with the liver transplant recipients.;;Jeon MK, Park YH;;kor;['Adult', 'Depression', 'End Stage Liver Disease/*therapy', 'Family Relations', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Personal Autonomy', '*Self-Management', 'Social Support'];['Chronic disease', 'Health behavior', 'Liver transplantation', 'Self care'];The authors declared no conflict of interest.;;10.4040/jkan.2017.47.5.663

Regrettably, a clear tool for the early detection of deterioration is still lacking. The SepsiVit study aims to determine whether continuous heart rate variability (HRV) measurement can provide an early warning  for deterioration in patients presenting with suspected infection or sepsis to the emergency department (ED). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The protocol of a prospective observational study in the ED. We will include 171 adult medical patients presenting with suspected infection or sepsis and at least two systemic  inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Patients with known pregnancy, cardiac transplantation or not admitted to our hospital are excluded.High sample frequency ECG signals (500 Hz), respiratory rate, blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation will be recorded continuously during the first 48 hours of hospitalisation using a bedside patient monitor (Philips IntelliVue MP70). Primary endpoint is patient deterioration, defined as the development of organ dysfunction, unplanned intensive care unit admission or in-hospital mortality. The ECG data will be used for offline HRV analysis. We will compare the HRV between two groups (deterioration/no deterioration) and analyse whether HRV provides an early warning for deterioration. Furthermore, we will create a multivariate predictive model for deterioration based on heart rate, respiratory  rate and HRV. As planned secondary analyses, we (1) perform a subgroup analysis for patients with pneumosepsis and urosepsis and (2) determine whether HRV using  lower sample frequencies (1 Hz or less) suffices to predict deterioration. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen granted a waiver for the study (METc 2015/164).

METHODS: The questionnaire survey adopted the bearer method and was sent to members of the Japanese Society of Emergency Pediatrics (JSEP). In both the surveys of 2008 and 2016, the same item ""Questionnaire survey on BD and organ transplant"" was disseminated. We compared the responses of the two surveys. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. Significance was observed when p value was less than 0.05. RESULTS: Comparison of the results of the two surveys in this study showed a change in awareness of BD/organ transplantation held by pediatric healthcare providers in Japan. It was suggested that Japanese pediatric healthcare providers tend to explain to the family that it is BD with incomplete diagnosis of BD. In the 2016 survey, there is an increase in the response ""There is experience of children diagnosed with BD"" and  it might be due to the effect of the amendment of the law (p = 0.0038). CONCLUSION: In July 2010, the ""Amendment of the Organ Transplant Law"" became effective, and it became possible to provide organs with family member consent even if the intention of the patient to provide organs was unknown.

However, organ shortage is becoming an increasing problem globally, limiting the applicability of liver transplantation. In addition, potential recipients are becoming sicker, thereby increasing the risk of losing the graft during transplantation or in the initial postoperative period after liver transplantation (three months). This trend is challenging the  model for end-stage liver disease allocation system, where the sickest candidates are prioritised and no delisting criteria are given. The weighting of the deontological demand for ""equity"", trying to save every patient, regardless of the overall utility; and ""efficiency"", rooted in utilitarianism, trying to save as many patients as possible and increase the overall quality of life of patients facing the same problem, has to be reconsidered. In this article we are aiming to overcome the widespread concept of futility in liver transplantation, providing a definition of potentially inappropriate liver transplantation and giving guidance on situations where it is best not to proceed with liver transplantation, to decrease the mortality rate in the first three months after transplantation. We propose ""absolute"" and ""relative"" conditions, where early post-transplant mortality is highly probable, which are not usually captured in risk scores predicting post-transplant survival. Withholding liver transplantation for listed patients in cases where liver transplant is not deemed clearly futile, but is potentially inappropriate, is a far-reaching decision. Until now, this decision had to be discussed extensively on an individual basis, applying explicit communication and conflict resolution processes, since the model for end-stage liver disease score and most international allocation systems do not include explicit delisting criteria to support a fair delisting process. More work is needed to better identify cases where transplantation is potentially inappropriate and to integrate and discuss these delisting criteria in allocation systems, following a societal debate on what we owe to all liver transplant candidates.";;Linecker M, Krones T, Berg T, Niemann CU, Steadman RH, Dutkowski P, Clavien PA, Busuttil RW, Truog RD, Petrowsky H;;eng;['End Stage Liver Disease/surgery', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/diagnosis', 'Liver Failure, Acute/surgery', '*Liver Transplantation/mortality', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Waiting Lists'];['*ACLF', '*ALF', '*CLF', '*Efficiency', '*Equity', '*Futile', '*Liver transplant', '*Organ shortage'];;;10.1016/j.jhep.2017.11.008

Transcripts were thematically analyzed. We identified ten themes on patients' considerations preceding PS: cautiousness in discussing living donation within social network; reluctance to accept a kidney from loved ones; rejection/withdrawal of related donor candidates; moral objections to paid donation; the ease of social media; encouraged by others; ends justifying the means; despair and urge to take action; public disclosure of vulnerability; fear of being (perceived to be) selfish.

1265;29129955;Article;2017;Acta bioethica;;A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF BIOETHICAL ISSUES FROM VIEW POINTS OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS ADMINISTRATION IN TURKEY, ROMAN CATHOLICISM AND ORTHODOX JUDAISM.;;The arguments set forth by religious authority are important since they play a crucial role in shaping the social values of the public and influence the decision of individuals in practice pertaining to bioethical issues. The Religious Affairs Administration (RAA) was established at the inception of the Republic of Turkey in 1924 to guide religious considerations moving out of the Ottoman caliphate to a secular bioethical framework. In this article, the bioethical views of the RAA under Islamic tradition is examined and contrasted with those influenced by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Judaic traditions. On bioethical deliberations related to the beginning and end-of-life, all three religious traditions justify sacredness of life and that of God's will in its preservation it. Assisted reproduction techniques between spouses is considered to be appropriate, although third party involvement is explicitly forbidden. Organ transplantation is approved by all three religious traditions, except uterine transplantation. Contraceptive practices are approved under certain conditions - views differ most on approaches to contraception and the appropriateness of methods. The RAA judgement on cloning is to prohibit it, like  Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Judaism. In other topics, cosmetic surgery and gender determination are approved only for treatment.;;Guvercin CH, Munir KM;;eng;;['Orthodox Judaism', 'Roman Catholicism', 'Turkey', 'bioethics', 'religious affairs administration'];There is no conflict of interest in this study.;R25 TW009248/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States;10.4067/S1726-569X2017000200327
1266;29110763;Article;2017;Seminars in nephrology;;Clinical Genetic Testing for APOL1: Are we There Yet?;;End-stage renal disease (ESRD) disproportionately affects African Americans, who  are two to four times more likely than European Americans to develop ESRD. Two independent variants of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene, G1 and G2, have been  associated with a 7- to 10-fold greater risk of developing nondiabetic ESRD in African Americans. Those who inherit two risk variants (G1/G1, G2/G2, or G1/G2) are also more likely to develop ESRD at a younger age and to have progression of  chronic kidney disease. Currently, it is not known what proportion of persons with high-risk genotypes will develop ESRD in the general population, the exact mechanism of injury for APOL1-related risk, its relation to environmental exposures, or whether patients with comorbid conditions are more likely to develop ESRD. To address the above uncertainties, research that includes assessment of APOL1 status is needed before guidelines for general testing can be endorsed. Currently, APOL1 testing has been proposed as part of kidney transplant protocols both for living donors and recipients. However, because of uncertainties regarding the clinical implications of APOL1 variants, testing could generate confusion, anxiety, or stigma. Multiple forms of evidence, including the views of community members, are needed to support responsible approaches to providing information about APOL1 status as part of clinical care or in population screening. Informed consent with subsequent counseling regarding the risks and benefits of APOL1 testing should be considered for patients at high risk.;;Young BA, Fullerton SM, Wilson JG, Cavanaugh K, Blacksher E, Spigner C, Himmelfarb J, Burke W;;eng;['African Americans/*genetics/psychology', 'Apolipoprotein L1/*genetics', 'Attitude', '*Genetic Testing/ethics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*genetics/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Mutation', 'Risk Assessment'];['*APOL1', '*African Americans', '*Genetic testing', '*apolipoprotein L1', '*kidney disease'];;R01 HG007879/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States;10.1016/j.semnephrol.2017.07.009

This raises the ethical question of whether a patient who is not eligible  for deceased donor liver transplantation should be eligible for living donor liver transplantation. We compare living organ donation in kidney and liver transplantation and explore key ethical concepts of justice, fairness, and societal trust. Ultimately, because there is no alternative life-preserving therapy in end-stage liver disease, and because transplantation with a living donor organ does not involve removing a resource from the common pool of transplant organs, we argue that a standard of ""slightly less benefit"" than that  required for deceased transplantation should be used to determine the acceptability of living donor liver transplantation.";;Lieber SR, Schiano TD, Rhodes R;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Liver Transplantation/adverse effects/*ethics/standards', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Graft Dysfunction/etiology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Waiting Lists'];['*Benefits', '*Ethics', '*Justice', '*Liver transplantation', '*Living donor', '*Organ transplantation', '*Risks', '*Trust'];;T32 DK007634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1016/j.jhep.2017.10.024

We conducted simulations using clinical data from 2 KPD registries-the Alliance for Paired Donation, which runs  multihospital exchanges, and Methodist San Antonio, which runs single-center exchanges-to study how the frequency of match-runs impacts the number of transplants and the average waiting times. We simulate the options facing each of the 2 registries by repeated resampling from their historical pools of patient-donor pairs and nondirected donors, with arrival and departure rates corresponding to the historical data. We find that longer intervals between match-runs do not increase the total number of transplants, and that prioritizing highly sensitized patients is more effective than waiting longer between match-runs for transplanting highly sensitized patients. While we do not find that frequent match-runs result in fewer transplanted pairs, we do find that increasing arrival rates of new pairs improves both the fraction of transplanted  pairs and waiting times.;;Ashlagi I, Bingaman A, Burq M, Manshadi V, Gamarnik D, Murphey C, Roth AE, Melcher ML, Rees MA;;eng;['*Algorithms', 'Donor Selection/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Registries', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration', 'United States', 'Waiting Lists'];['*donors and donation: paired exchange', '*economics', '*ethics and public policy', '*health services and outcomes research', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;R18 HS020610/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.14566
1270;29084036;Article;2017;ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992);;Patients' Perspectives on Transplantation While Undergoing Left Ventricular Assist Device Support.;;"Left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy is a growing mechanical circulatory support therapy used to treat patients with advanced heart failure. There is a general assumption among clinicians that patients would prefer to accept a heart  to any other treatment were they eligible. However, little research has been done to clarify the nuances of patient treatment preferences for LVAD therapy versus transplantation. The objective of this study was to investigate this treatment preference assumption from patients' perspectives. In a single-site study, 15 LVAD patients, 15 LVAD candidates, 15 LVAD decliners, and 15 LVAD caregivers (n = 60) participated in structured, in-depth interviews to assess decisional processes and treatment preferences for advanced heart failure. The interview guides were consistent with the Ottawa framework on decision-making processes. All participants were identified by the LVAD coordination team and recruited consecutively between February and November 2014. The patient and candidate groups included both LVAD designations: destination therapy (n = 22), bridge-to-transplant (n = 4), as well as four participants who deferred designation pending worsening clinical status. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative description with constant comparisons, aided by ATLAS.ti. Although LVAD eligible patients generally show a preference for heart transplantation as the ideal treatment for heart failure, some patients begin to show ambivalence as they experience LVAD therapy and begin to prefer LVAD as a long-term, destination treatment. Some themes that emerged from the interviews concerning transplantation centered on the consequences of multiple major surgeries (i.e., LVAD placement followed by heart transplantation, n = 18), fears surrounding lifestyle changes of accepting a heart transplant (n = 14) and life satisfaction  with an LVAD as a ""new normal"" (n = 18). Findings suggest that experience with an LVAD can sometimes cause ambivalence about transplant with some patients preferring LVAD as destination even when transplant is an option. We provide clinical and programmatic implications of this, concluding with practical recommendations for how to fully address patients' goals of treatment as their health and situation changes over time.";;Wilhelms LA, Blumenthal-Barby JS, Kostick KM, Estep JD, Bruce CR;;eng;['Decision Making', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Heart Failure/therapy', 'Heart Transplantation/*psychology', 'Heart-Assist Devices/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged'];;;;10.1097/MAT.0000000000000567

Citizens are encouraged to make their organ donation decision known during their lifetime. In  order to work, the Act and media campaign need to create a context, whereby organ donation becomes the norm, and create a mechanism for people to behave as intended (formally register their decision; consider appointing a representative; convey their donation decision to their families and friends or do nothing-deemed consent). In addition, family members/appointed representatives need to be able to put their own views aside to support the decision of their loved one. The aim  of this study is to evaluate initial implementation, outcomes and impact on families and appointed representatives who were approached about organ donation during the first 18 months. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Prospective mixed-method coproductive study undertaken with National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), and multiple patient/public representatives. The study is designed to collect information on all cases who meet specified criteria (>/=18 years, deceased person voluntarily resident in Wales and died in Wales or England) whose family were approached between 1 December 2015 and 31 June 2017). Data for analysis include: NHSBT routinely collected anonymised audit data on all cases; Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation (SNOD) completed anonymised form for all cases documenting their perception of the families' understanding of the Act, media campaign and outcome of the donation approach; questionnaires and depth interviews with any family member or appointed representative (minimum 50 cases).

Transplant communication has not been explored in SA, and this study was the first to use health communication methods to generate empirical evidence  relating to it. OBJECTIVE: To explore communication in transplant settings in Gauteng Province, SA. METHODS: Qualitative methods were used to collect data across six hospitals and transplant centres in Gauteng. State and private institutions were equally represented. Health professionals and transplant co-ordinators participated. Thematic analysis of data was undertaken. RESULTS: Facilitators of interprofessional transplant communication included appreciation  of its importance to good practice and cohesive individual transplant teams. Barriers to interprofessional communication were observed when individual teams had to come together in a multi-team, interdisciplinary environment, when interchange became aggressive, and when information was not passed on to other health professionals timeously. These barriers had implications for continuity of care and ethics, which could lead to moral distress. CONCLUSION: Transplantation  in Gauteng is characterised by aspects of good teamwork, and the importance of effective communication is acknowledged. Transplantation also faces some challenges in terms of interprofessional communication. Recommendations for mitigating some of the gaps include integrating a health communication specialist into the transplant process, 'knotworking', the use of apology, and an advance warning text-message system for transplant professionals.;;Etheredge HR, Penn C, Watermeyer J;;eng;;;;;10.7196/SAMJ.2017.v107i7.12355

In an attempt to improve the availability of donor allografts and reduce waiting list mortality, graft acceptance criteria were extended increasingly over the decades. The use of extended criteria donor (ECD) allografts is associated with a higher incidence of primary graft non-function and/or delayed graft function. As such, several strategies have been developed aiming at reconditioning poor quality ECD liver allografts. Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) has been successfully tested in preclinical experiments and in few clinical series of donation after cardiac death OLT. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: HOPE ECD-DBD is an investigator-initiated, open-label, phase-II, prospective multicentre randomised  controlled trial on the effects of HOPE on ECD allografts in donation after brain death (DBD) OLT. Human whole organ liver grafts will be submitted to 1-2 hours of HOPE (n=23) via the portal vein before implantation and are going to be compared  with a control group (n=23) of patients transplanted after conventional cold storage. Primary (peak and Delta peak alanine aminotransferase within 7 days) and secondary (aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin and international normalised ratio, postoperative complications, early allograft dysfunction, duration of hospital and intensive care unit stay, 1-year patient and graft survival) endpoints will be analysed within a 12-month follow-up. Extent of ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury will be assessed using liver tissue, perfusate, bile and serum samples taken during the perioperative phase of OLT.

One potential group of donors are those who have been transplant recipients themselves, or Organ Donation After Transplant (ODAT) donors. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to describe ODAT donors and to compare outcomes of ODAT grafts versus conventional grafts. From October 1, 1987 to June 30, 2015, 517 former recipients successfully donated 803 organs for transplant. Former kidney recipients generally survived a median of approximately 4 years before becoming an ODAT donor whereas liver, lung, and heart recipients generally survived less than a month prior to donation. In the period June 1, 2005 to December 31, 2014,  liver grafts from ODAT donors had a significantly higher risk of graft failure compared to non-ODAT liver transplants (P = .008). Kidney grafts donated by ODAT  donors whose initial transplant occurred >1 year prior were associated with significantly increased graft failure (P = .012). Despite increased risk of graft failure amongst certain ODAT grafts, 5-year survival was still high.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of 5 databases to find manuscripts addressing ethical concerns related to UE allotransplantation. Inclusion criteria were papers that were on the topic of UE allotransplantation,  and related ethical concerns, written in English. We extracted and categorized ethical themes under the 4 principles of bioethics: Autonomy, Beneficence, Nonmaleficence, and Justice. We assessed theme frequency by publication year using Joinpoint regression, analyzing temporal trends, and estimating annual percent change. RESULTS: We identified 474 citations; 49 articles were included in the final analysis. Publication years were 1998 to 2015 (mean, 3 publications/y; range, 0-7 publications/y). Nonmaleficence was most often addressed (46 of 49 papers; 94%) followed by autonomy (36 of 49; 74%), beneficence (35 of 49; 71%), and justice (31 of 49; 63%). Of the 14 most common themes, only ""Need for More Research/Data"" (nonmaleficence) demonstrated a significant increase from 1998 to 2002. CONCLUSIONS: Upper extremity transplantation is an appealing reconstructive option for patients and physicians. Its life-enhancing (vs life-saving) nature and requirement for long-term immunosuppression have generated much ethical debate. Availability of human data has influenced ethical concerns over time. Our results indicate that discussion of ethical issues in the literature increased following publication of UE transplants and outcomes as well as after meetings of national societies and policy decisions by regulatory agencies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because UE transplantation is not a life-saving procedure, much ethical debate has accompanied its evolution. It is important for UE surgeons considering referring  patients for evaluation to be aware of this discussion to fully educate patients  and help them make informed treatment decisions.";;Cooney CM, Siotos C, Aston JW, Bello RJ, Seal SM, Cooney DS, Shores JT, Brandacher G, Lee WPA;;eng;['Beneficence', 'Hand Transplantation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Patient Selection', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment'];['*Ethics', '*VCA', '*composite tissue allotransplantation', '*hand transplantation', '*upper extremity allotransplantation'];;;10.1016/j.jhsa.2017.08.004

OBJECTIVES: To describe the derivation and implementation of a protocol for DCCD in Israel and report on  the results with the first six cases. METHODS: After receiving approval from an extraordinary ethics committee, Ministry of Health, the steering committee of the National Transplant Center defined and reached consensus on the unique challenges presented by a DCCD program. These protocol included medical aspects (construction of a clinical pathway), social and ethical aspects (presentation of the protocol at a public gathering(, legal/ethical aspects (consent for organ preservation procedures being either implied if the donor had signed an organ donor card or received directly from a surrogate decision maker), and logistical  aspects (pilot study confined to kidney retrieval and to four medical centers). Data regarding organ donors and recipients were recorded. RESULTS: The protocol was implemented at four medical centers. Consent for organ donation was received  from four of the six potential donors meeting criteria for inclusion, in all cases, from a surrogate decision maker. Of the eight kidneys retrieved, only four were suitable for transplantation, which was carried out successfully for four recipients. Graft function remained normal in all cases in 6-12 months follow-up.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This ongoing prospective observational study of the medical management  of deceased organ donors will enrol more than 650 consented potential donors from adult intensive care units at 33 hospital sites across Canada, each participating for 12 months. ODOs ensure enrolment of consecutive eligible participants. Research staff record detailed data about participants, therapies, organ assessments, death declaration procedures and adverse clinical exposures from the time of donation consent to organ recovery. ODOs provide reasons that organs are  declined, dates and places of transplantation, and recipient age and sex.Descriptive analyses will summarise current practices. Effectiveness analyses will examine donation-specific interventions with respect to the number of transplants, using multilevel regression models to account for clustering by donor, hospitals and ODOs. Feasibility analyses will focus on acceptance of the research consent model; participation of academic and community hospitals as well as ODOs; and accessibility of recipient data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study uses a waiver of research consent. Hospitals will receive reports on local  practices benchmarked to (1) national practices and (2) national donor management guidelines. We will report findings to donation and transplant collaborators (ie, clinicians, researchers, ODOs) and publish in peer-reviewed journals.

This review aims to summarise what is known about non-adherence, with a view to providing comprehensive evidence to inform strategies aimed at advancing adherent behaviour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review of quantitative studies that report adherence to immunosuppressants in adult (over 18 years) renal transplant recipients. The review will follow the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines; study quality will be assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Systematic searches will be completed across relevant databases. Two reviewers will independently extract data using a predefined data extraction  form. We will summarise the operationalisation of adherence across studies and use narrative synthesis to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A meta-analysis will be conducted if there is sufficient homogeneity, and available data, across studies to estimate the prevalence of non-adherence in renal transplant recipients. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I(2) test. Survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratios to explore the impact of non-adherence on graft survival, graft failure and patient survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated at conferences for professionals and researchers. Review outcomes will help support clinical practice by highlighting the extent of non-adherence among adults, and in doing so, signpost the need for suitable intervention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four-way kidney exchange transplant procedures were approved by the ethics committee of our institution and the Organ Transplantation Authorization Committee of state governments of India (as per the Transplantation of Human Organs Act of India). The protocols conformed to Declaration of Istanbul principles and the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from patients, donors, and their guardians. RESULTS: In April 2016, our transplant team completed simultaneous 4-way kidney exchange transplant procedures without any medical (rejection and infections) or  surgical complications. Reasons for being included for kidney exchange transplant were ABO incom-patible (2 recipients) and sensitization (2 recipients). All 4 recipients had stable graft function with no proteinuria and donor-specific antibody at 11-month follow-up on standard triple immunosup-pression. Patient and graft survival rates were both 100%. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first single-center report of 4-way kidney exchange transplant combined with desensitization from India. This procedure has the potential to expand living-donor kidney transplant in disadvantaged groups (eg, sensitized patients). Recipients who are hard to match due to high panel reactive antibody and difficult to desensitize due to strong donor-specific antibodies can receive  a transplant with a combination of kidney exchange and desensitization. Our study suggests that 4-way kidney exchange transplant can be performed in developing countries (India) similar to that shown in programs in developed countries with team work, kidney exchange registry, and counseling.;;Kute VB, Patel HV, Shah PR, Modi PR, Shah VR, Kasat GS, Patil MV, Patel JC, Kumar DP, Trivedi HL;;eng;['ABO Blood-Group System/immunology', 'Adult', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Desensitization, Immunologic/*methods', '*Directed Tissue Donation', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft Survival', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'India', 'Isoantibodies/blood/immunology', 'Kidney Transplantation/*methods', 'Living Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.6002/ect.2017.0089

The objective of this research was to describe the cDCD consent policies of U.S. transplant hospitals, including consent for antemortem interventions (AMI), in order to inform the development of a more rigorous and sound consent process. METHODS: Cross-sectional study data of cDCD policies of U.S. transplant hospitals were collected between July 2013 and October 2014. Respondents submitted their policies for investigator review and/or completed a 25-item Web-based survey describing their hospital's cDCD and AMI policies. There were 209 U.S. adult transplant hospitals identified through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). RESULTS: One hundred responses were received, representing 48% of all 209 U.S. transplant hospitals and 60% of the 168 transplant centers with an identified knowledgeable informant. In 79 policies (79%), organ procurement organization representatives (OPOs) are given sole responsibility for obtaining signed cDCD consent. Thirty-four policies (34%) give OPOs the responsibility for  obtaining written AMI consent, 13 policies give it to treating physicians, and 6  policies state that AMI consent must be obtained collaboratively. Treating physicians have no delineated responsibilities in the cDCD and AMI consent process in 70 (70%) and 58 (58%) policies, respectively. We observed wide variability in the acceptability of first-person authorization (FPA) for cDCD and AMI; FPA was rejected as evidence of consent for cDCD and AMI in 7 and 11 policies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The cDCD consent policies of U.S. transplant hospitals are highly variable and inconsistent in addressing key aspects of the consent process. The major policy differences observed raise questions about what constitutes a sound and comprehensive cDCD consent policy.";;Hardart GE, Labriola MK, Prager K, Morris MC;;eng;['Adult', '*Cardiovascular System', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Death', '*Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Physicians', '*Policy', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['*cardiac death', '*consent documents', '*hospital ethics', '*informed consent', '*organ donation', '*organ procurement'];;;10.1080/23294515.2017.1363319

General population risk scores for CVD underestimate the risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suggesting additional non-traditional factors. Renal transplant recipients also exhibit elevated inflammation and impaired immune function. Exercise has a positive impact on these factors in patients with CKD but there is a lack of rigorous research in RTRs, particularly surrounding the feasibility and acceptability of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in this population. This study aims to explore the feasibility of three different supervised aerobic exercise programmes in RTRs to guide the design of future large-scale efficacy studies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Renal transplant recipients will be randomised to HIIT A (16 min interval training with 4, 2 and 1 min intervals at 80%-90% of peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak)), HIIT B (4x4 min interval training at 80%-90% VO2peak) or MICT (~40 min cycling at 50%-60% VO2peak) where they will undertake 24 supervised sessions (approximately  thrice weekly over 8 weeks). Assessment visits will be at baseline, midtraining,  immediate post-training and 3 months post-training. The study will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, retention, assessment procedures and the implementation of the interventions. A further qualitative sub-study QPACE-KD (Qualitative Participant Acceptability of Exercise in Kidney Disease) will explore patient experiences and perspectives through semistructured interviews and focus groups.

Of 114 centers, 61 (53.5%) responded to the survey, representing 49.2% of the LT volume in 2016. Only two programs considered chronic opioid (1 [1.6%]) or OST use (1 [1.6%]) absolute contraindications to transplant, while 63.9% and 37.7% considered either one a relative contraindication, respectively. The majority of programs did not have a written policy regarding chronic opioid use (73.8%) or OST use (78.7%) in LT candidates. Nearly half (45.9%) of centers agreed that there should be a national consensus policy addressing opioid and OST use. The majority of responding LT centers did not consider opioid or OST use in LT candidates to be absolute contraindications to LT, but there was significant variability in center practices. These surveys also demonstrated a lack of written policies in the assessment of the candidacy of such patients.

The transplantation was ultimately unsuccessful, but it opened doors for further research on both live and cadaveric UTx. While initial strides toward successful transplantation have been made, questions persist on the ethics of UTx: whether the uterus is a vital  organ, whether we should prioritize live or cadaveric options, and how the procedure should be covered by health insurance. If we agree that the goal of the medical profession is both to treat and improve quality of life, then the question of whether or not infertility is considered a disease becomes inconsequential in the discussion. As such, the medical enterprise should move forward with research in UTx. In doing so, considering the ethical implications of UTx remains essential-and we must remember to pair innovation with regulation.;;Zaidi D;;eng;['Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/surgery', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];;;;

Discussions cluster around a number of central moral and political/theoretical themes: (1) What are the direct and indirect health care costs and benefits of such a voucher system in human organs? (2) Do vouchers lead to more effective and efficient organ procurement and allocation or contribute to greater inequalities and inefficiencies in the transplantation system? (3) Do vouchers contribute to the inappropriate commodification of human body parts? (4) Is there a significant moral difference between such a voucher system and a market in human organs for transplantation?

It focuses mainly on an issue of inequity. A disparity exists in US kidney transplantation.  Although African-Americans suffer far higher rates of ESRD than whites, African-Americans are much less likely than whites to get a transplant (Ilori et  al., 2015, 1). The article explores the voucher program in light of this disparity. It motivates the view that, at least in the short term, more whites than African-Americans are likely to take advantage of the voucher program. The program is, thus, likely to increase the gap in transplantation rates between the two groups.

As a relatively new practice, the ethical implications of advanced kidney donation have not yet been widely discussed. This paper reflects on some of the bioethical issues at stake in this new donation program, as well as some broader philosophical issues related to the meaning and moral salience of commodification. I first consider whether the literature on commercial markets in organs--a longstanding topic of bioethical debate--can meaningfully inform ethical analysis of kidney voucher programs. Specifically, I consider whether and to what extent common objections to the exchange of kidneys for cash also apply to the exchange of kidneys for ""kidney vouchers."" Second, I argue that the contrast between the ethical issues raised by these two practices highlights the  need to understand commodification as existing on a continuum, with different degrees of commodification giving rise to different ethical issues. Doing so can  help sharpen our understanding of commodification as a moral concept, as well as  its relevance to broader debates about the moral limits of markets.";;Koplin JJ;;eng;['Bioethical Issues', 'California', '*Commodification', 'Directed Tissue Donation/ethics', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Human Body', 'Humans', '*Kidney', '*Program Development', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/organization & administration'];['advanced donation', 'commodification', 'kidney donation', 'kidney voucher', 'organ transplantation'];;;10.1093/jmp/jhx017

Advocates of financial incentive programs or ""regulated markets"" in kidneys present the problem of the kidney shortage as one of insufficient public  motivation to donate, arguing that incentives will increase the number of donors. Others believe the solutions lie-at least in part-in facilitating so-called ""altruistic donation;"" harnessing the willingness of relatives and friends to donate by addressing the many barriers which serve as disincentives to living donation. Strategies designed to minimize financial barriers to donation and the  use of paired kidney exchange programs are increasingly enabling donation, and now, an innovative program designed to address what has been termed ""chronologically incompatible donation"" is being piloted at the University of California, Los Angeles, and elsewhere in the United States. In this program, a person whose kidney is not currently required for transplantation in a specific recipient may instead donate to the paired exchange program; in return, a commitment is made to the specified recipient that priority access for a living-donor transplant in a paired exchange program will be offered when or if the need arises in the future. We address here potential ethical concerns related to this form of organ ""banking"" from living donors, and argue that it offers significant benefits without undermining the well-established ethical principles  and values currently underpinning living donation programs.";;Martin DE, Danovitch GM;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Directed Tissue Donation/ethics', 'Family', 'Humans', '*Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Morals', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['advanced donation', 'ethics', 'kidney transplant', 'living donation'];;;10.1093/jmp/jhx015

If the use of such vouchers as incentives for donors is morally permissible, then cash payments for kidneys are also morally permissible. But, that argument faces five objections. First, there are some goods whose nature allows them to be exchanged for similar goods but renders them monetarily inalienable. Hence, kidneys might be exchanged for kidneys but not sold for cash. Second, voucher programs respect donor autonomy, whereas the offer of cash payments does not. Third, the burden of proof lies with the advocates of  cash payments for kidneys to show that their benefits would outweigh the costs of their legalization. Fourth, allowing cash payments for kidneys would stifle medical innovation. Fifth, allowing cash payments for kidneys would result in these organs being used as collateral to secure loans-and that this would disadvantage potential borrowers who did not want to risk their kidneys in this way.

1305;28857844;Article;2017;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;The ethical challenges of uterus transplantation.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the techniques of uterus transplantation have evolved, culminating in a birth in 2014, the ethical debate has been enriched by several considerations. Uterus transplantation raises issues because of its unique features of being temporary, nonlifesaving, experimental, and expensive, with established alternatives. RECENT FINDINGS: Uterus transplantation entails risks for the recipient related to multiple surgeries and immunosuppression, yet studies have shown that women see infertility as a distressing element in their lives, justifying the risks. The alternative of surrogacy has its own ethical issues, and adoption does not provide for genetic progeny. Although patient decisions are susceptible to inconsistent reasoning, misconception of risks or wishful thinking, a carefully drafted and clearly explained informed consent can  represent a valid ethical response in balancing risks and benefits. There is no evidence of increased risks for children born from uterus transplant. For living  donors, the risks of hysterectomy are known and can be explained to facilitate proper informed consent. Allocation of deceased donor organs needs to be determined, as guidelines for other organs cannot readily be applied. Cost is an  issue, as the procedure is expensive and not covered by insurance.

In this article, we  argue that an appeal to the distinction between appearance and reality fails in defending the view that the 'brain dead' are dead. Specifically, this view relies on an inaccurate and overly simplistic account of the role of medical technology  in the physiology of a 'brain dead' patient. We conclude by offering an explanation of why the conventional view on 'brain death', though mistaken, continues to be endorsed in light of its connection to organ transplantation and  the dead donor rule.;;Nair-Collins M, Miller FG;;eng;['*Attitude to Death', 'Biology', '*Brain Death', 'Death', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Neurology', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Personhood', '*Public Policy', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['*death', '*definition/determination of death'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2016-103867

1309;28838898;Article;2017;BMJ open;;Protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial of metformin in pre-diabetes after kidney transplantation: the Transplantation and Diabetes (Transdiab) study.;;"INTRODUCTION: Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common complication of kidney transplantation and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the general population, metformin has been used for diabetes prevention in high-risk individuals. Improving insulin sensitivity is one of many proven favourable effects of metformin. Despite the high incidence of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients, there is a lack of evidence for the role of metformin in the prevention of diabetes in this setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Transplantation and Diabetes (Transdiab) is a single-centre, unblinded, pilot randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy  of metformin after renal transplantation in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Participants will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test in the  4-12 weeks post-transplantation; those with IGT will be randomised to standard care or standard care and metformin 500 mg twice daily, and followed up for 12 months. The primary outcomes of the study will be the feasibility of recruitment, the tolerability of metformin assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating  Scale at 3 and 12 months, and the efficacy of metformin assessed by morning glucose and glycated haemoglobin at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Despite the significant morbidity and mortality of PTDM, there are currently no randomised clinical trials assessing pharmacological interventions for its prevention after kidney transplantation. The Transdiab trial will thus provide important data on the feasibility, safety, tolerability and efficacy of metformin after renal transplantation in patients with IGT; this will facilitate  undertaking larger multicentre trials of interventions to reduce the incidence or severity of diabetes after kidney transplantation. This study has been approved by the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health in New Zealand. On study completion, results are expected to be published  in a peer-reviewed journal.

This deeply rooted cultural tradition is unlikely to be abolished. Conventional reconstructive techniques using free vascularised tissue flaps with penile implants are undesirable in this often socioeconomically challenged group because donor site morbidity can hinder manual labour and vigorous sexual activity might lead to penile implant extrusion. The psychosociological effects of penile loss in a young man are devastating and replacing it with the same organ is likely to produce the maximum benefit. METHODS: We first performed a cadaver-to-cadaver penile transplantation as preparation. After approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee was obtained, we recruited potential recipients. We screened the potential participants for both physical and psychological characteristics, including penile stump length, and emotional suitability for the procedure. A suitable donor became available and the penis was harvested. We surgically prepared the penile stump of the recipient and attached the penile graft. Immunosuppression treatment with antithymyocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone were commenced. Tadalafil at 5 mg once per  day was commenced after 1 week as penile rehabilitation and was continued for 3 months. We collected on quality-of-life scores (Short Form 36 version 2 [SF-36v2] questionnaires) before surgery and during follow-up and measured erectile function (International Index for Erectile Function [IIEF] score) and urine flow  rates at 24 months post transplant. FINDINGS: The warm ischaemia time for the graft after removal was 4 min and the cold ischaemia time was 16 h. The surgery lasted 9 h. An arterial thrombus required urgent revision 8 h after the operation. On post operative day 6, an infected haematoma and an area of proximal skin necrosis were surgically treated. The recipient was discharged after 1 month and first reported satisfactory sexual intercourse 1 week later (despite advice to the contrary). The recipient reported regular sexual intercourse from 3 months after the operation. An episode of acute kidney injury at 7 months was reversed by reducing the tacrolimus dose to 14 mg twice per day. At 8 months after surgery, the patient had a skin infection with phaeohyphomycosis due to Alternaria alternata, which we treated with topical antifungal medication. Quality-of-life scores improved substantially after the operation (SF-36v2 mental health scores improved from 25 preoperatively, to 57 at 6 months and 46 at 24 months post transplant; physical health scores improved from 37 at baseline to 60 at 6 months and 59 at 24 months post-transplant). At 24 months, measured maximum  urine flow rate (16.3 mL/s from a volume voided of 109 mL) and IIEF score (overall satisfaction score of 8 from a maximum of 10) were normal, showing normal voiding and erectile function, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Penile transplantation restored normal physiological functions in this transplant recipient without major complications in the first 24 months.

We conducted face-to-face interviews with family members (N = 15) who had direct experience with unsuccessful DCD and 5 focus groups with professionals involved in the donation process. We used qualitative content analysis to characterize the harms  of nondonation as perceived by participants. Participants reported a broad spectrum of harms affecting organ recipients, donors, and donor families. Harms included waste of precious life-giving organs and hospital resources, inability to honor the donor's memory and character, and impaired ability for families to make sense of tragedy and cope with loss. Donor families empathized with the initial hope and ultimate despair of potential recipients who must continue their wait on the transplant list. Focus group members reinforced these findings and highlighted the struggle of families to navigate the uncertainty regarding the timing of death during the donation process. While families reported significant  harm, many appreciated the donation attempt. These findings highlight the importance of organ donation to donor families and the difficult experiences associated with current processes that could inform development of alternative donation strategies.;;Taylor LJ, Buffington A, Scalea JR, Fost N, Croes KD, Mezrich JD, Schwarze ML;;eng;['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiovascular System', '*Death', '*Decision Making', 'Family/*psychology', 'Family Conflict', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods/*standards', 'Young Adult'];['*donors and donation', '*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*ethics and public policy', '*health services and outcomes research', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*organ transplantation in general', '*qualitative research'];;T32 CA090217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.14464

An explorative multicenter longitudinal study among anonymous living kidney donors and recipients.;;Anonymity between living donors and recipients is a topic of discussion among transplant professionals. This longitudinal study explored living kidney donors'  and patients' perspectives on anonymity. Prior to surgery (T0) and 3 months afterward (T1), participants in unspecified or specified indirect donation programs completed a questionnaire on their experiences with and attitudes toward anonymity as well as demographic and medical characteristics. Nonparametric tests were used to assess group differences and associations. Participants were content with anonymity at T0 and T1. Fourteen and 23% wanted to meet at T0 and T1, respectively. If the other party expressed the wish to meet, 50% (T0) and 55% (T1) would be willing to meet. Most participants agreed that meeting should be allowed if both parties agree. Attitude toward anonymity did not differ between donors/recipients, nor between T0/T1 and unspecified/specified indirect donation  programs. This study showed that most donors and recipients who participated in anonymous donation schemes are in favor of a conditional approach to anonymity. Guidelines on how to revoke anonymity if both parties agree are needed and should include education about pros and cons of (non-) anonymity and a logistical plan on how, when, where, and by whom anonymity should be revoked.;;Pronk MC, Slaats D, van der Pant KAMI, Vervelde J, Dooper IM, Dor FJMF, Weimar W, van de Wetering J, Zuidema WC, Massey EK;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Confidentiality/ethics/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*methods', 'Living Donors/ethics/*psychology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods', 'Transplant Recipients/*psychology', 'Young Adult'];['kidney transplantation', 'medical ethics', 'organ donation', 'paired kidney exchange', 'unrelated donors'];;;10.1111/tri.13016

Little is known about how donor factors, timing of procurement, and geographic location affect organ offer decisions. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 47 563 deceased donor kidney match-runs from 2007 to 2013. Several characteristics unrelated to allograft quality were independently associated with later acceptance in the match-run: Public Health Service increased-risk donor status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.29-2.69), holiday or weekend procurement (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.16), shorter donor stature (aOR 1.53 for <150 cm vs reference >180  cm, 95% CI 1.28-1.94), and procurement in an area with higher intensity of market competition (aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.62-1.78) and with the longest waiting times (aOR  1.41, 95% CI 1.34-1.49). Later acceptance in the match-run was associated with delayed graft function but not all-cause allograft failure (adjusted hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.96-1.07). Study limitations include a lack of match-run data for discarded organs and the possibility of sequence inaccuracies for some nonlocal matches.

There  is no consensus on what level of IPV constitutes a risk of graft loss. The establishment of such a threshold could help to guide clinicians in identifying at-risk patients to receive targeted interventions to improve IPV and thus outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre Transplant Audit Collaborative has  been established to conduct a retrospective study examining tacrolimus IPV and renal transplant outcomes. Patients in receipt of a renal transplant at participating centres between 2009 and 2014 and fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be included in the study. The aim is to recruit a minimum of 1600 patients with follow-up spanning at least 2 years in order to determine a threshold IPV above which a renal transplant recipient would be considered at increased risk of graft loss. The study also aims to determine any national or regional trends in IPV and any demographic associations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Consent will not  be sought from patients whose data are used in this study as no additional procedures or information will be required from participants beyond that which would normally take place as part of clinical care. The study will be registered  locally in each participating centre in line with local research and development  protocols. It is anticipated that the results of this audit will be disseminated  locally, in participating NHS Trusts, through national and international meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals.;;Goldsmith PM, Bottomley MJ, Okechukwu O, Ross VC, Ghita R, Wandless D, Falconer SJ, Papachristos S, Nash P, Androshchuk V, Clancy M;;eng;['Adult', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft Rejection/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Renal Insufficiency/*surgery', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tacrolimus/blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom'];['nephrology', 'transplant medicine', 'transplant surgery'];Competing interests: The Transplant Audit Collaborative acknowledges financial support from Astellas Pharma UK in the facilitation of meetings, in the provision of training opportunities for its members and in funding publication costs.

It is therefore increasingly important to identify potential organ donors in order to realize organ donation. An escalation of intensive care measures is often required, which raises critical ethical questions. In Germany, organ donation is only allowed after brain death with prior informed consent from the deceased or his/her relatives. Determining the willingness of the potential organ donor and adapting the subsequent intensive care to it requires experience and empathy. Therapy escalation for the realization of organ donation is not opposed  to the basic ethical principles of medicine, but remains an individual decision.  A time limitation of this last intensive therapy phase to achieve optimal conditions for transplantation should be discussed with the relatives and adapted to the medical requirements.

Early statistical evidence suggests that this has had a positive impact on cadaveric organ donation. Such a system for procurement has previously been dismissed by the Organ Donation Taskforce, who suggested that opting out could potentially undermine the concept of donated organs as gifts and this could then  negatively impact the number of organs offered for transplant. Considerable weight was placed upon the need to retain the altruistic gift element associated  with an opt-in system. This article will consider the role of altruism in an organ procurement policy.

A possible donor was defined as a ventilated inpatient death </=75 years of age, without multi-organ system failure, sepsis, or cancer, whose cause of death was consistent with organ donation. These estimates were compared to patient-level data from chart review from two large OPOs. Among 2,907,658 inpatient deaths from 2009-2012, 96,028 (3.3%) were a ""possible deceased-organ donor."" The two proposed metrics of OPO performance were: (1) donation percentage (percentage of possible  deceased-donors who become actual donors; range: 20.0-57.0%); and (2) organs transplanted per possible donor (range: 0.52-1.74). These metrics allow for comparisons of OPO performance and geographic-level donation rates, and identify  areas in greatest need of interventions to improve donation rates.

The construction of mechanisms to promote the sharing of benefits and solidarity in the field of international cooperation in the area of renal health involves the recognition of bioethical issues related to access to RRT in the BRICS countries.;;Ferraz FHRP, Rodrigues CIS, Gatto GC, Sa NM;;por;['Bioethical Issues', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Developing Countries', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Disparities/*economics', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/economics/*therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation/economics/methods', 'Public Health', 'Renal Replacement Therapy/economics/*methods'];;;;10.1590/1413-81232017227.00662017
1328;28698998;Article;2017;Monash bioethics review;;Does organ selling violate human dignity?;;Shortages in the number of donated organs after death and the growing number of end-stage organ failure patients on waiting lists call for looking at alternatives to increase the number of organs that could be used for transplantation purposes. One option that has led to a legal and ethical debate is to have regulated markets in human organs. Opponents of a market in human organs offer different arguments that are mostly founded on contingent factors that can be adjusted. However, some authors have asked the question whether we still have a reason to believe that there is something wrong with offering human  organs for sale for transplantation purposes, even if the circumstances under which the practice takes place are improved. One prominent argument regarding this appeals to the notion of human dignity. It is argued that organ selling violates human dignity. This paper presents a systematic discussion of dignity-based arguments in the organ selling debate, and then develops a social account of dignity. It is argued that allowing the practice of organ selling inherently runs the risk of promoting the notion that some persons have less worth than others and that persons have a price, which is incompatible with dignity. The approach is defended against possible objections and it is shown that it can capture the notion that autonomy is linked to human dignity in important ways, while dignity at the same time can constrain the autonomous choices of persons with regards to certain practices.;;Alpinar-Sencan Z, Baumann H, Biller-Andorno N;;eng;['*Commerce', 'Dissent and Disputes', 'Humans', 'Morals', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Personal Autonomy', '*Personhood', '*Respect', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/*ethics'];['Autonomy', 'Dignity', 'Dignity as a constraint', 'Dignity as empowerment', 'Organ donation', 'Organ markets', 'Organ selling'];;;10.1007/s40592-017-0070-x

Method: Research-intervention developed with four heart transplant patients linked to a reference transplant hospital in Ceara. Data was collected through interviews in 2014 and analyzed using Parse's theoretical framework and pertinent literature. Resultados: Transplant patients revealed they gave living in such condition an ambiguous meaning, showing satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Dietary restrictions, difficulties with medication and curiosity about the transplant were identified as disharmonies involving the process. Care was developed focused on educating the transplant patients, approaching the themes healthy eating, organ rejection,  immunosuppressant use and facts about heart transplantation.

It would be of interest to learn whether the attitude of the clinical staff involved in such trials changes as the trials are carried out in their own hospital. METHODS: One hundred and four clinical staff members from the Eva Peron Hospital of San Martin (Buenos Aires, Argentina) where clinical trials of islet xenotransplantation have been performed and 92 similar staff members from the Diego Thompson Hospital (Buenos Aires, Argentina) where no such xenotransplantation has been carried out participated in the study. Data were collected anonymously using questionnaires.  RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between the acceptance of xenotransplantation by clinical personnel in a hospital that had carried out clinical xenotransplantation trials were observed when compared with the acceptance of a similar staff from the hospital that had not carried out such trials. CONCLUSION: This study shows that involvement in clinical xenotransplantation trials significantly changes the attitude of the clinical staff towards this technology and suggests that better information given to the society may increase acceptance of the xenotransplantation.;;Abalovich A, Matsumoto S, Wechsler CJ, Carulla ME, Siciliano ME, Sznaider D, Denner J, Elliott RB;;eng;['Animals', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1', 'Heterografts/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Islets of Langerhans/*cytology', '*Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/methods', 'Kidney/cytology', '*Kidney Transplantation/methods', 'Patient Selection', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Swine', '*Transplantation, Heterologous/methods'];['*Xenotransplantation', '*efficacy', '*ethics', '*safety'];;;10.1111/xen.12315
1337;28622010;Article;2018;Health communication;;"""Are You In or Are You Out?!"" Moral Appeals to the Public in Organ Donation Poster Campaigns: A Multimodal and Ethical Analysis.";;Organ transplantation is a well-established practice in modern medicine. However, many countries, especially those with an opt-in regulation, face the problem of low donation numbers. Respective public campaigns attempt to increase the number  of donors by swaying public opinion with the use of carefully selected bits of information. Germany serves as a case study for an opt-in country investing approximately euro7.5 million/year in the distribution of respective campaigns. To address diverse populations, large-scale posters in various public spaces still display a multitude of moral messages for organ donation. We developed a detailed multimodal approach for the analysis of health communication by focusing exemplarily on such organ donation poster campaigns as a common mean since the 1990s. In all, we identified 13 campaigns with 83 posters from 1996 to 2016. Here, we focus on both the textual and visual elements of such material to analyze how morally relevant principles and virtues are interwoven. Six categories of moral appeals were identified in the complete sample: altruism, being a decisive person, family responsibility, minimizing suffering, social conformity, and complete reciprocity. Overall, visual items were used to create a variety of social, moral, and epistemic claims with respect to organ donation. Our analysis reveals critical aspects highlighting the potential conflicts that arise from the ambiguity and wrong information of some messages as well as the risk of inappropriate blaming driven by these campaigns.;;Hansen SL, Eisner MI, Pfaller L, Schicktanz S;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Awareness', 'Germany', 'Health Communication/*methods', 'Humans', '*Moral Obligations', 'Personal Autonomy', '*Public Opinion', 'Social Responsibility', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration'];;;;10.1080/10410236.2017.1331187

METHODS: One-hundred consecutive adults were enrolled at an urban, Midwestern transplant center. Demographic, clinical, and quality of life data were collected prior to patients visit with a transplant surgeon/nephrologist (evaluation begins). Patient-reported barriers to evaluation completion were collected using the Subjective Barriers Questionnaire 90-days after the initial medical evaluation appointment (evaluation ends), our center targeted goal for transplant work-up completion. RESULTS: At 90 days, 40% of participants had not completed the transplant evaluation. Five barrier categories were created from the 85 responses to the Subjective Barriers Questionnaire. Patient-reported barriers included poor communication, physical health, socioeconomics, psychosocial influences, and access to care. In addition, determinants for successful evaluation completion included being of white race, higher income, free of dialysis, a lower comorbid burden, and reporting higher scores on the Kidney Disease Quality of Life subscale role-emotional. CONCLUSION: Poor communication between patients and providers, and among providers, was the most prominent patient-reported barrier identified. Barriers were more prominent  in marginalized groups such as ethnic minorities and people with low income. Understanding the prevalence of patient-reported barriers may aid in the development of patient-centered interventions to improve completion rates.;;Lockwood MB, Saunders MR, Nass R, McGivern CL, Cunningham PN, Chon WJ, Josephson MA, Becker YT, Lee CS;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Aged', 'Asian Americans', 'Cohort Studies', '*Communication', 'Comorbidity', '*Ethnic Groups', 'European Continental Ancestry Group', 'Female', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Humans', '*Income', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Minority Groups', '*Physician-Patient Relations', 'Poverty', 'Preoperative Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', '*Renal Dialysis', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Young Adult'];['*barriers', '*evaluation', '*inequities', '*kidney', '*transplant'];;;10.1177/1526924817699957

In this article, we review the current limitations and challenges in 3D bioprinting, including in situ techniques, which are one of several clinical translational models to facilitate the application of this technology from bench to bedside. A detailed discussion is made on the technical barriers in the fabrication of scalable constructs that are vascularized, autologous, functional, implantable, cost-effective, and ethically feasible. Clinical considerations for implantable bioprinted tissues are further expounded toward the correction of end-stage organ dysfunction and composite tissue deficits.;;Ravnic DJ, Leberfinger AN, Koduru SV, Hospodiuk M, Moncal KK, Datta P, Dey M, Rizk E, Ozbolat IT;;eng;['*Bioprinting/economics/ethics', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods/*trends'];;;K12 HD055882/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/SLA.0000000000002141
1342;28583564;Article;2017;Transplantation proceedings;;Recognition of Kidney Donation by Living Kidney Donors That Accompanies Changes in the Recipients' Physical Condition: Focusing on Its Influences on Donors.;;"INTRODUCTION: In 2013, a total of 1586 kidney transplants were performed in Japan, and 1431 (90.2%) of the organs were from living donors. The purpose of this study is to illuminate the awareness of living kidney donors toward kidney donation after the condition of the recipient changed, thus clarifying the influence of that recognition on the donor. METHODS: This study design was qualitative descriptive research. Transplant coordinators at 4 hospitals were commissioned to screen subject candidates and hand-deliver printed research explanations to them. Candidates who responded were selected as subjects. I conducted semistructured interviews and analyzed them using the grounded theory approach. This research was approved by the Ethics Research Committee, Faculty of Nursing, Toho University. RESULTS: The survey period was from April to November 2014, and consent was obtained from 5 donors and 5 recipients. The outcome of recipients who received kidneys from the 5 donors was as follows: recovered after temporary worsening (n = 3), early graft loss (n = 1), and early death (n = 1). The core category was ""to the donor, the meaning of kidney donation is continually redefined."" The donors had a strong interest in the physical condition of the recipient. The 3 changes in the recipients' physical condition,  defined as ""recovery,"" ""temporary worsening,"" and ""complete deterioration,"" affected the donor's condition. CONCLUSION: Due to changes in the recipient's physical condition, donors' psychological and physical condition and their definition of the meaning of kidney donation also changed.

1344;28575014;Article;2017;PloS one;;The outcomes and controversies of transplant tourism-Lessons of an 11-year retrospective cohort study from Taiwan.;;BACKGROUND: Transplant tourism has increased rapidly in the past two decades, accounting for about 10% of world organ transplants. However it is ethically controversial and discouraged by professional guidelines. We conducted this study to investigate the outcomes and trends of overseas kidney and liver transplantation in Taiwan to provide a sound basis for ethical reflection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify 2381 domestic and 2518 overseas kidney transplant (KT) recipients from 1998 to 2009 and 1758 domestic and 540 overseas liver transplantation (LT) recipients from 1999 to 2009. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risks of mortality and graft failure. The numbers  of overseas transplantation increased after 2000, reached a peak in 2005 and decreased after 2007. Compared to their domestic counterparts, the overseas KT recipients were older, male predominant, with shorter pre-op dialysis period and  more comorbidities. Similarly, the overseas LT recipients were older, male predominant and had more hepatocellular carcinoma cases. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year  patient survival rates were 96.9%, 91.7% and 83.0% respectively for domestic KT and 95.8%, 87.8% and 73.1% for overseas KT (p<0.001). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 89.2%, 79.5%, 75.2% for domestic LT and 79.8%, 54.7%, 49.9% for overseas LT (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The poorer outcomes of the overseas  groups may be due to more older patients, more comorbidities (KT), or more hepatocellular carcinoma recurrences (LT). After domestic reform and international ethical challenges, the numbers of organ tourism decreased but the  practice still persisted surreptitiously. Compulsory registration policies for overseas transplantation with international conventions to sanction organ trafficking and transplant tourism should be considered to stop these controversial practices.;;Tsai DF, Huang SW, Holm S, Lin YP, Chang YK, Hsu CC;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', '*Medical Tourism', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Taiwan'];;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0178569
1345;28574902;Article;2017;Transplantation;;Advanced Donation Programs and Deceased Donor-Initiated Chains-2 Innovations in Kidney Paired Donation.;;Kidney paired donation (KPD) strategies have facilitated compatible living-donor  kidney transplants for end-stage renal disease patients with willing but incompatible living donors. Success has inspired further innovations that expand  opportunities for kidney-paired donation. Two such innovations are the advanced donation strategy in which a donor provides a kidney before their recipient is matched, or even in need of, a kidney transplant, and deceased donor initiated chains in which chains are started with deceased donors rather than altruistic living donors. Although these innovations may expand KPD, they raise several ethical issues. Specific concerns raised by advanced donation include the management of uncertainty, the extent of donor and recipient consent, the scope of the obligation that the organization has to the kidney exchange paired recipient, the naming of alternative recipients, and the potential to unfairly advantage the recipient. Use of deceased donors for chain-initiating kidneys raises ethical issues concerning the consent process for each involved party, the prioritization of deceased donor kidneys, the allocation of chain ending kidneys, and the value of a living donor kidney versus a deceased donor kidney. We outline each ethical issue and discuss how it can be conceptualized and managed so that these KPD innovations programs are ultimately successful.;;Wall AE, Veale JL, Melcher ML;;eng;['Altruism', 'Death', 'Directed Tissue Donation', 'Donor Selection/ethics', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*methods', 'Living Donors/ethics', 'Nephrectomy', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods/standards'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000001838

The clinical outcome for carefully selected patients is very favorable, especially for the young and active and graft survival up to 25 years has been described in the literature. Furthermore, a high patient satisfaction rate has been reported, but the biggest obstacle to overcome is the availability of tissue for transplantation. Large fresh bone allografts for cartilage damage repair only can be harvested from organ donors following organ removal or cadaveric donors, preferably in the setting of an operation room to minimize possible contamination of the tissue. Apart from the logistic challenges this entails, an experienced recovery team is needed. Furthermore, the public as well as medical staff is much less aware of the possibility and requirements of tissue donation than organ donation and families of deceased are  rarely approached for bone and cartilage donation. This review aims to highlight  the current situation of organ and tissue donation in Europe with special focus on the processing of bones and possible safety and quality concerns.

1351;28510355;Article;2017;American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons;;The National Landscape of Living Kidney Donor Follow-Up in the United States.;;In 2013, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/ United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) mandated that transplant centers collect data on living  kidney donors (LKDs) at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postdonation, with policy-defined thresholds for the proportion of complete living donor follow-up (LDF) data submitted in a timely manner (60 days before or after the expected visit date). While mandated, it was unclear how centers across the country would  perform in meeting thresholds, given potential donor and center-level challenges  of LDF. To better understand the impact of this policy, we studied Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for 31,615 LKDs between January 2010 and June 2015, comparing proportions of complete and timely LDF form submissions before and after policy implementation. We also used multilevel logistic regression to assess donor- and center-level characteristics associated with complete and timely LDF submissions. Complete and timely 2-year LDF increased from 33% prepolicy (January 2010 through January 2013) to 54% postpolicy (February 2013 through June 2015) (p < 0.001). In an adjusted model, the odds of  2-year LDF increased by 22% per year prepolicy (p < 0.001) and 23% per year postpolicy (p < 0.001). Despite these annual increases in LDF, only 43% (87/202)  of centers met the OPTN/UNOS-required 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year LDF thresholds  for LKDs who donated in 2013.

Appraising proposed strategies using an empirical ethics analysis.;;"Utilising empirical ethics analysis, we evaluate the merits of systems proposed to increase deceased organ donation in South Africa (SA). We conclude that SA should maintain its soft opt-in policy, and enhance it with 'required transplant  referral' in order to maximise donor numbers within an ethically and legally acceptable framework. In SA, as is the case worldwide, the demand for donor organs far exceeds the supply thereof. Currently utilising a soft opt-in system,  SA faces the challenge of how to increase donor numbers in a context which is imbued with inequalities in access to healthcare, multiplicitous personal beliefs and practices, distrust of organ transplant and varying levels of education and health literacy. We argue that a hard opt-in, opt-out or mandated consent system  would be problematic, and we present empirical data from Gauteng Province illustrating barriers to ethically sound practice in soft consent systems. Ultimately, we argue that in spite of some limitations, a soft opt-in system is most realistic for SA because its implementation does not require extensive public education campaigns at national level, and it does not threaten to further erode trust at a clinical level. However, to circumvent some of the clinical-level barriers identified in our empirical study, we propose a contextually sensitive option for ""enabling"" soft opt-in through ""required transplant referral"". We argue that this system is legally defensible, enhances ethical practice and could also increase donor numbers as it has in many other countries.";;Etheredge H, Penn C, Watermeyer J;;eng;['Culture', 'Educational Status', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Literacy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', '*Organ Transplantation', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Referral and Consultation', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'South Africa', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Trust'];['South Africa', 'communication', 'empirical ethics', 'opt-in', 'opt-out', 'organ donation', 'organ transplant'];;;10.1111/dewb.12154

A systematic review and meta-analysis.;;Although social support is used to determine transplant eligibility, the relationship between social support, medication adherence, and survival among transplant recipients remains unclear. We estimated the relationship between social support and post-transplant medication adherence and outcomes using 10 electronic databases from inception to January 2016. Study quality was assessed and all review stages were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Thirty-two studies (9102 participants) met inclusion criteria: 21 assessed medication adherence (5197 participants), and 13 assessed clinical outcomes (3905 participants). Among high quality studies, neither social support nor marital status was predictive of medication adherence  or post-transplant outcomes. Social support was not associated with medication adherence. It was associated with superior post-transplant outcomes, but the relationship was not significant among high quality studies. Compared to unmarried recipients, married recipients were more likely to adhere to medication post-transplant, but this relationship was not significant among high quality studies. Marital status was not significantly associated with transplant success. Social support is weakly and inconsistently associated with post-transplant adherence and outcomes. Larger prospective studies using consistent and validated measures are needed to justify the use of inadequate social support as a contraindication to transplantation.;;Ladin K, Daniels A, Osani M, Bannuru RR;;eng;['Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Medication Adherence', '*Social Support', 'Transplant Recipients/*psychology'];;;K23 AT009374/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States;10.1016/j.trre.2017.04.001

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary care liver transplant center after obtaining ethics and institutional approvals. A total of 42 potential LLD MRI examinations were performed between November 2013 and March 2016. All patients underwent a standard MRI protocol which included MRCP and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI sequences in a single session. Three abdominal MR radiologists independently reviewed the studies and completed  a customized data collection sheet for each MR sequence. The readers subjectively scored the bile duct visualization on each MR sequence on a Likert scale and classified the biliary anatomic configuration. Statistical analysis was performed using intraclass correlation coefficient and the McNemar Chi-square (chi (2)) test. RESULTS: The 42 potential LLDs included 22 males and 20 females with an age range of 18-60 years. There was 'good' or 'excellent' inter-reader agreement on either MRI examination for the visualization of the first- and second-order ducts and the majority of third-order ducts. 'Good' inter-reader agreement on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and 'fair' inter-reader agreement on MRCP was noted for  the left third-order medial duct. There was significantly better visualization of the cystic duct, left hepatic duct, and right second-order ducts on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI compared with MRCP. A 12.6% improvement in classifying the biliary branch pattern was also observed on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI compared with MRCP (P = 0.03).

1360;28457402;Article;2017;Transplantation proceedings;;Early Vascular Thrombosis After Kidney Transplantation: Can We Predict Patients at Risk?;;"BACKGROUND: Renal transplant is the therapy of choice for patients with chronic renal disease. In recent years, improvement in immunosuppressive drugs reduced early graft loss associated with acute rejection. However, vascular thrombosis, accounting for 5% of early graft loss, can sensitize the recipient for human leukocyte antibodies, reducing the chance for a second transplant. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for vascular thrombosis in a single transplant center, to design specific prevention protocol. METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-control study. From the Renal Transplant Unit database, we identified 21 cases of vascular thrombosis in recipients of kidneys from deceased donors. Recipients from the contralateral kidney from the same donor, without vascular complications, were assigned to the control group. Data analyzed included donor, recipient, transplant surgery, and post-operative follow-up. The  local ethics committee approved the protocol. RESULTS: Thrombosis and control groups were comparable for recipient characteristics, cold ischemia time, organ side (right or left), and site of arterial anastomosis. We observed an increased  risk for vascular thrombosis in kidneys with multiple veins (odds ratio, 11.32; P = .03). Organ retrieval surgery complications, such as vascular lesions or heterogeneous perfusion, despite normal pre-implantation biopsy, were considered  risk factors for vascular thrombosis within the first post-operative day (odds ratio, 7.1; P = .03).

1361;28437370;Article;2017;Transplantation;;Ethics Guide Recommendations for Organ-Donation-Focused Physicians: Endorsed by the Canadian Medical Association.;;Donation physicians are specialists with expertise in organ and tissue donation and have been recognized internationally as a key contributor to improving organ  and tissue donation services. Subsequent to a 2011 Canadian Critical Care Society-Canadian Blood Services consultation, the donation physician role has been gradually implemented in Canada. These professionals are generally intensive care unit physicians with an enhanced focus and expertise in organ/tissue donation. They must manage the dual obligation of caring for dying patients and their families while providing and/or improving organ donation services. In anticipation of actual, potential or perceived ethical challenges with the role,  Canadian Blood Services in partnership with the Canadian Medical Association organized the development of an evidence-informed consensus process of donation experts and bioethicists to produce an ethics guide. This guide includes overarching principles and benefits of the DP role, and recommendations in regard to communication with families, role disclosure, consent discussions, interprofessional conflicts, conscientious objection, death determination, donation specific clinical practices in neurological determination of death and donation after circulatory death, end-of-life care, performance metrics, resources and remuneration. Although this report is intended to inform donation physician practices, it is recognized that the recommendations may have applicability to other professionals (eg, physicians in intensive care, emergency medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, pulmonology) who may also participate in the end-of-life care of potential donors in various clinical settings.

1363;28437367;Article;2017;Transplantation;;"""Effective"" Requesting: A Scoping Review of the Literature on Asking Families to  Consent to Organ and Tissue Donation.";;"BACKGROUND: Families are often asked to consent to the donation of their deceased relative's organs or tissues. These end-of-life conversations are important because they affect consent rates as well as the psychological impact of the decision for families. This scoping review of the literature on requesting family consent was prepared to support of the development of leading practice recommendations for end-of-life conversations with families of potential donors.  A scoping review maps research activity in a field across a range of commentary and empirical study designs but does not attempt meta-synthesis of empirical data or quality assessment. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature from January 2000 to February 2015 on the questions of what constitutes an ""effective"" request and the factors that affect consent rates and family satisfaction with their decision and the process. This review includes a final set of 168 articles addressing (a) whether, when, and how to ask families for consent to donation or (b) characteristics of families or decedents that affect families' decisions or family satisfaction with their decisions. RESULTS:  Six main themes were identified: (1) the objectives of requesting and encouraging family consent to donation, (2) the effect of the donation decision on family well-being, (3) the process of requesting family consent, (4) the impact of the quality of the care for the deceased and for the family, (5) the content and manner of the request for family consent, and (6) the characteristics of the family and deceased that affect the request for family consent. CONCLUSION: This  scoping review found that there is a large literature on how to modify the process and manner of the request to increase family consent rates. Another important line of inquiry focuses on the psychological impact of the decision on  the family. Although a scoping review does not attempt to synthesize results or draw evidence-based conclusions, the literature generally supports the intuitive  expectations that compassionate and respectful care for the deceased and family,  listening for and addressing family concerns, and an attitude to donation that is positive (but not solely procurement-focused) and is best for both consent rates  and family well-being. Although the presumption is often that the primary objective of asking for family consent is to secure consent and donation, some ethical commentary on requesting consent emphasizes that this objective must be balanced with the parallel obligation to protect the psychological well-being of  families. This places some constraints on the approaches used in family consent discussions.";;Chandler JA, Connors M, Holland G, Shemie SD;;eng;['Attitude to Death', 'Communication', 'Family/*psychology', 'Family Relations', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Presumed Consent/ethics', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Terminal Care/psychology', '*Third-Party Consent/ethics', '*Tissue Donors/ethics', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics'];;;CIHR/Canada;10.1097/TP.0000000000001695

The shift away from saving lives to seeking to make them better  requires a shift in the ethical thinking that has long formed the foundation of organ transplantation.

Yet, it is unclear whether variation in liver availability is arbitrary and a disparity requiring rectification or reflects differences in access to care. We evaluate the proposal's claim that organ supply is an ""accident of geography"" by examining the relationship between local organ supply and the uneven landscape of social determinants and policies that contribute to differential death rates across the  United States. We show that higher mortality leading to greater availability of organs may in part result from disproportionate risks incurred at the local level. Disparities in public safety laws, health care infrastructure, and public  funding may influence the risk of death and subsequent availability of deceased donors. These risk factors are disproportionately prevalent in regions with high  organ supply. Policies calling for organ redistribution from high-supply to low-supply regions may exacerbate existing social and health inequalities by redistributing the single benefit (greater organ availability) of greater exposure to environmental and contextual risks (e.g. violent death, healthcare scarcity). Variation in liver availability may not be an ""accident of geography""  but rather a byproduct of disadvantage.";;Ladin K, Zhang G, Hanto DW;;eng;['Geography', 'Healthcare Disparities/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Public Policy', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'United States'];['disparities', 'editorial/personal viewpoint', 'ethics', 'ethics and public policy', 'law/legislation', 'liver transplantation/hepatology', 'liver transplantation: auxiliary', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement and allocation'];;;10.1111/ajt.14301

As liver transplants became more successful and demand rose, livers became a scarce resource. A national system has been implemented to prioritize liver allocation according to disease severity, but the system still operates within the original procurement regions, some of which have significantly more deceased donor livers. Although each region prioritizes its sickest patients to be liver transplant recipients, the sickest in less liver-scarce regions get transplants much sooner and are at far lower risk of death than the sickest in more liver-scarce regions. This has resulted in drastic and inequitable regional  variation in preventable liver disease related death rate.A new region districting proposal - an eight district model - has been carefully designed to reduce geographic inequities, but is being fought by many transplant centers that face less scarcity under the current model. The arguments put forth against the new proposal, couched in terms of fairness and safety, will be examined to show that the new system is technologically feasible, will save more lives, and will not worsen socioeconomic disparity.

Are there grounds to require it, and to forbid access to live donor transplantation to a recipient who fails to signal that he feels any form of gratitude? Recipient gratitude is not currently required for organ donation, but it is expected and may be a moral requirement. Despite this, we argue that making it a condition for live organ transplantation would be unjustified. It would constitute a problematic and disproportionate punishment for perceived immoral behaviour on the part of the recipient. It would also bar the donor from positive aspects of organ donation that remain even in the absence of recipient gratitude. A potential recipient's lack of gratitude should be explored as a possible symptom  of other morally problematic issues and integrated into the information provided  to the potential donor. Recognition of the donor's gift and gratitude for it may  also need to be expressed in part by others.

We introduce the concept of a reciprocity-based strategy in which the recipient of a CP who participates in KPD receives priority for a repeat deceased donor transplant in the event their primary living donor KPD transplant fails, and then we review the practical and ethical considerations of this strategy. The strategy limits prioritization to CPs already committed to living donation, minimizing the risk of unduly influencing donor behavior. The provision of a tangible benefit independent of the CP's actual KPD match avoids many of the practical and ethical challenges with strategies that rely on finding the CP recipient a better-matched kidney that might provide the CP recipient a future benefit to increase KPD participation. Specifically, the strategy avoids the potential to misrepresent the degree of future benefit of a better-matched kidney to the CP recipient and minimizes delays in transplantation related to finding a better-matched kidney. Preliminary estimates suggest the strategy has significant potential to increase  the number of living donor transplants.

Although the technology is not yet at the level required to bioprint an entire organ, 3D bioprinting may have a variety of other mid-term and short-term benefits that also have positive ethical consequences, for example, creating alternatives to animal testing, filling a therapeutic need for minors and avoiding species boundary crossing. Despite a lack of current socioethical engagement with the consequences of the technology, we outline what we see as some preliminary practical, ethical and regulatory issues that need tackling. These relate to managing public expectations and the continuing reliance on technoscientific solutions to diseases that affect high-income countries. Avoiding prescribing a course of action for the way forward in terms of research agendas, we do briefly  outline one possible ethical framework 'Responsible Research Innovation' as an oversight model should 3D bioprinting promises are ever realised. 3D bioprinting  has a lot to offer in the course of time should it move beyond a conceptual therapy, but is an area that requires ethical oversight and regulation and debate, in the here and now.

1376;28306592;Article;2017;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Bridging the gap in heart transplantation.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Countries in Europe and in the USA are proclaiming their need  for an objective allocation system that can cope with distribution of a scarce resource in a changing environment of an older donor and recipient population and of an increased number of patients on mechanical circulatory support, whose prospects are increasing. RECENT FINDINGS: The current heart allocation systems in Eurotransplant, France and the USA are all urgency tier systems, where within  the same tier a first-come, first-served principle is applied. Both Eurotransplant and France are developing new heart allocation schemes that hinge  on a benefit principle, thereby combining the prospects of patients after transplantation with their expected clinical course while on the waiting list. In the USA, a different approach has been chosen for their new allocation scheme, as the medical urgency of the patient is the driving force behind the proposal. SUMMARY: Policies to ensure a fair, efficient, and medically optimal matching of  donor organs and recipients are continually evaluated and refined. The ethical cornerstone of each organ allocation policy in the described countries is the effort of balancing justice and utility.;;Smits JM, Samuel U, Laufer G;;eng;['Heart Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000408

Penile transplantation is a novel vascularized composite allotransplantation treatment option for severe penile tissue loss and disfigurement. Three allogeneic human penile transplantations have been reported. We review these cases as well as penile transplant indications, preclinical models and immunosuppression therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review for the years 1970 to 2016 via MEDLINE(R), PubMed(R) and Google with the key words ""penis transplantation,"" ""penile rejection,"" ""penile replantation,"" ""penile tissue loss"" and ""penis vascularized composite allotransplantation."" Relevant articles, including original research, reviews and nonscientific press reports, were selected based on contents, and a review of this literature was generated. RESULTS: Three human allogeneic penile transplantations have been performed to date, of which 1 was removed 14 days after transplantation. The second recipient  reports natural spontaneous erections and impregnating his partner. All 3 patients were able to void spontaneously through the graft's urethra. The complexity of the transplant is determined by how proximally the penile shaft anastomosis is performed and additional pelvic tissue may be transplanted en bloc if needed. CONCLUSIONS: Penile transplantation is a technically demanding procedure with significant ethical and psychosocial implications that can provide tissue and functional replacement, including urinary diversion and natural erections. It is unclear how rejection and immunosuppression may affect graft function. Better models and more preclinical research are needed to better understand and optimize penile transplantation.";;Sopko NA, Tuffaha SH, Lough D, Brandacher G, Lee WPA, Bivalacqua TJ, Redett RJ, Burnett AL;;eng;['Graft Rejection/immunology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression/methods', 'Male', 'Penile Erection/physiology', 'Penis/blood supply/injuries/*transplantation', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/adverse effects/ethics/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures, Male/adverse effects/ethics/*methods', 'Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation/adverse effects/ethics/*methods'];['*graft rejection', '*penis', '*penis agenesis', '*tissue transplantation'];;;10.1016/j.juro.2016.10.134

The only legal alternative for these women to get parenthood is adoption which is accepted by most world societies and countries. Surrogate pregnancy is connected with many medical, ethical, legal, religious and social controversies in the great part of the world.Donors (in living donation), recipients, partners and also unborn children must be incorporated into the analysis of ethical risks and benefits of uterus transplantation. The main ethical risks for the recipient are surgery, immunosuppression, pregnancy and delivery. All the potential recipients have to be advised about further ethical issues like organ rejection, infection, side effects of the drugs, unsatisfactory fertilization and different complications during pregnancy.Uterus procurement in  donor takes longer time than in standard hysterectomy due to preparation of uterine arteries and veins. Vessels with 2 mm diameter and their anatomical collision with ureter are connected with higher peroperative risk of uneventful surgical complications. Ethical issues might be connected with the uterus procurement in dead brain donors identically.The deliveries after uterus transplantation are fruitful but the risk of preterm delivery and immaturity of the newborns cannot be underestimated as well.;;Chmel R, Novackova M, Pastor Z, Matecha J, Cekal M, Fronek J;;cze;['Female', 'Humans', '*Infertility, Female/surgery', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Pregnancy', 'Tissue Donors', '*Uterus/transplantation'];['absolute uterine factor infertility', 'efficacy safety.', 'ethics', 'infertility', 'uterus transplantation'];;;
1380;28260434;Article;2017;Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation;;Difficult Consent Scale: An Assessment Scale for Anticipated Difficulty in Obtaining Consent for Organ Donation.;;"OBJECTIVES: Seeking consent for organ procurement from a brain-dead patient 's family is challenging, especially in developing countries. In the Middle East, legislation necessitates an opt-in system that engages all first-degree relatives. To improve our success rate in the Masih Daneshvari Organ Procurement  Unit in Tehran, Iran, we invented a scale for the consent process to predict the  degree of difficulty of each family interview before venturing into it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of brain-dead patients treated in our unit over the previous 10 years. Focusing on cases where families refused to donate organs, we searched for determinants that played a role in the final results. We  extracted minor and major determinants, then ascribed a 3-level scale to each determinant (from 1, easiest, to 3, most difficult). We thereby obtained a clear  assessment of each consent-taking session based on determinants from real encounters. RESULTS: We analyzed 150 brain-dead patients and extracted 17 determinants: 2 major and 15 minor. We grouped these into 3 distinct categories:  A, patient-related; B, family-related; C, hospital-related. Inspired by the Glasgow Coma Scale, we named our scale the ""Difficulty Consent Scale, "" in which  a score of 15, using the minor determinants, indicates the easiest scenario for obtaining consent and 45 indicates the most difficult scenario. The 2 major factors function as coefficients to either double or halve the degree of difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: This speculative model may help the managers of organ procurement units choose the best-suited person for any family interview, and it  may help clinicians attempting to obtain consent to compare their results over time.

We developed an ethical approach to conducting research on individuals  who opted out of living kidney donation and applied it in a small-scale qualitative study at one US transplant centre. The seven study participants (64%  response rate) had varied reasons for opting out, the most prominent of which was concern about the financial burden from lost wages during the postoperative period. Several reported feeling alone during their decision-making process. Although no participants used an alibi, a centre-provided statement of non-eligibility to donate, all believed that centres should offer alibis to help  preserve donor autonomy. Given the complexity of participants' decisions and the  emotions they experienced before and after deciding not to donate, we suggest approaches for independent living donor advocates to support this population.

Some consider that selection process should prioritize access to liver transplantation (LT) for patients who develop liver failure ""through no fault of their own"" even  if limiting care because of a patient's perceived responsibility has been considered unethical. The absence of improvement after alcohol withdrawal, the high short-term mortality risk and the poor predictability of the 6-month rule in post-LT relapse in alcohol consumption in AH patients not responding to medical therapy led to recommend an evaluation of LT. In the French-Belgian pilot study,  26 patients with severe AH not responding to medical therapy underwent early LT (eLT). Stringent selection criteria were applied. Six-month and 2-year survivals  of eLT patients were better than that of non-transplanted matched controls: 77% vs 23% and 71% vs 23% respectively. Alcohol relapse occurred in 12% of patients after eLT. Three studies confirmed these results. The impact organ donation should be limited as showed by a recent survey and the efforts that should be made in public information campaigns based on scientific data and medical ethics.

I propose the concepts that alcohol use disorder is an illness, that on occasion results in alcoholic liver disease and that treatment of alcoholic liver disease, including treatment of patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, combines treatment of the alcohol use disorder and of alcoholic liver disease. From this I derive the following principal to govern selection of patients for liver transplantation of patients with alcohol use disorder: that alcohol use disorder should impact suitability for liver transplantation as a co-morbid disorder, in the same way as other common co-morbid disorders such as diabetes mellitus or systemic hypertension, are factored in the selection process.

This is exemplified by the fact that most of these patients will not have had a period of abstinence prior to consideration for transplantation. Both abstinence before transplantation and the duration of abstinence are important predictors of post-transplant relapse. Furthermore, relapse after transplantation has been associated with accelerated graft injury and increase mortality. Recent pilot studies have demonstrated a benefit in short-term survival with early transplantation in highly selected small number of patients compared to matched controls. The results of these studies raises the possibility of extending graft  allocation to these subjects. Despite stringent assessment and a multi-tiered approach to selecting out patients for transplantation, the relapse rate was not  insignificant at 12%. As the long-term outcome remains unclear, further relapses  with time can still occur. These studies also highlight the fact that the overwhelming majority of subjects with severe AH who are non-responsive to medical therapy are not suitable for LT. Indeed, further large-scale multicentre  prospective studies with long-term follow-up are required to confirm the preliminary findings.;;Fung JY;;eng;['Alcohol Abstinence', 'Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects', 'Graft Survival', 'Hepatitis, Alcoholic/complications/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', '*Patient Selection', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution'];['*alcohol hepatitis', '*alcoholic liver disease', '*liver transplantation'];;;10.1111/liv.13286

Access to dialysis for ESKD is limited by insufficient infrastructure and catastrophic out-of-pocket costs. Most patients remain undiagnosed, untreated, and die. We did a systematic literature review to  assess outcomes of patients who reach dialysis and the quality of dialysis received. METHODS: We searched PubMed, African Journals Online, WHO Global Health Library, and Web of Science for articles in English or French from sub-Saharan Africa reporting dialysis outcomes in patients with ESKD published between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 22, 2015. No studies were excluded to best represent the current situation in sub-Saharan Africa. Outcomes of interest included access to dialysis, mortality, duration of dialysis, and markers of dialysis quality in patients with ESKD. Data were analysed descriptively and reported using narrative synthesis. FINDINGS: Studies were all of medium to low quality. We identified 4339 studies, 68 of which met inclusion criteria, comprising 24 456 adults and 809 children. In the pooled analysis, 390 (96%) of 406 adults and 133 (95%) of 140 children who could not access dialysis died or were presumed to have died. Among those dialysed, 2747 (88%) of 3122 adults in incident ESKD cohorts, 496 (16%) of 3197 adults in prevalent ESKD cohorts, and 107 (36%) of 294 children with ESKD died or were presumed to have died. 2508 (84%) of 2990 adults in incident ESKD cohorts discontinued dialysis compared with 64 (5%) of 1364 adults  in prevalent ESKD cohorts. 41 (1%) of 4483 adults in incident ESKD cohorts, 2280  (19%) of 12 125 adults in prevalent ESKD cohorts, and 71 (19%) of 381 children with ESKD received transplants. 16 studies reported on management of anaemia, 17  on dialysis frequency, eight on dialysis accuracy, and 22 on vascular access for  dialysis INTERPRETATION: Most patients with ESKD starting dialysis in sub-Saharan Africa discontinue treatment and die.

We therefore propose the term donation after brain circulation determination of death [DBCDD]. RESULTS: In DBCDD, death is determined when the cessation of circulatory function is permanent but before it is irreversible, consistent with  medical standards of death determination outside the context of organ donation. Safeguards to prevent error include that: 1] the possibility of auto-resuscitation has elapsed; 2] no brain circulation may resume after the determination of death; 3] complete circulatory cessation is verified; and 4] the cessation of brain function is permanent and complete. Death should be determined by the confirmation of the cessation of systemic circulation; the use of brain death tests is invalid and unnecessary. Because this concept differs from current standards, consensus should be sought among stakeholders. The patient or surrogate should provide informed consent for organ donation by understanding the basis of the declaration of death.

RESULTS: A total 74 recipients and donors were reviewed by the Hospital Transplant Ethics  Committee in 2014. Donors initiated the talks about being a donor (75%) to repay  the good deeds that were done by the recipient for them or their families; examples of which are: sometime in their lives they needed financial assistance for hospitalization for their relatives and it was the patient who paid the hospital bill; or because they pitied the recipient, whom they found to be a good person, thus they would want to give one of their kidneys. Seventy-four (100%) said that they were not expecting anything in return for this act but wanted to be of help to the recipient. Of these 74 cases, 70 cases (95%) were approved and  the others were disapproved.

The goal of this article is to examine the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice within the context of long-term VAD patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Survival rates in VAD-implanted patients have improved in parallel with modernization of device design and surgical technique, reaching that of cardiac transplantation at 1 year post-procedure. Even the sickest patients, those once deemed transplant-ineligible, have been proven to benefit from device implantation and in some cases to a point of becoming eligible for cardiac transplantation. Nevertheless, VAD implantation remains a high-risk procedure with in-hospital mortality rates reaching up to 27% post-procedure and requires intensive upkeep even after successful implantation. Furthermore, end-of-life decisions are complicated by consideration of device deactivation in patients who may not die immediately from an otherwise lethal pathophysiology. Ethical considerations in selection of patients, goals of implantation, and length of therapy become important to preserve the efficacy of treatment and maximize resource utilization. Advanced directives, shared decision-making, and multi-disciplinary approach to treatment have been shown to improve outcomes with respect to both survival and quality of life.;;Cai A, Eisen HJ;;eng;['Aging', 'Equipment Design/ethics', 'Heart Failure/mortality/*therapy', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Assist Devices/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Patient Selection/ethics', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome'];['*Advanced heart failure', '*Ethical considerations', '*Ventricular assist device'];;;10.1007/s11897-017-0313-4

We report our case of laparoscopic right graft resection with venous outflow reconstruction using cadaveric common iliac artery allograft in our center and review literatures about total LLDRH surgery. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: A 40-year-old male living donor for right hepatectomy was selected after pretransplant evaluation including laboratory tests, liver volume, anatomy of hepatic vein, artery, portal vein, and bile duct. Living donor liver transplantation surgery was approved by Sichuan Provincial Health Department and the ethics committee of the West China Hospital, Sichuan University. INTERVENTIONS: Hepatic parenchyma transection was performed by ultrasonic scalpel and Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA). Right branch of portal vein, right hepatic artery, right hepatic duct, and right hepatic vein were meticulously dissected. The right hepatic duct was ligated and  transected 2 mm far from the bifurcation of common hepatic duct, right hepatic artery, and portal vein were also ligated and transected, the right hepatic vein  was transected by laparoscopic linear cutting stapler. The gap between short hepatic veins and right hepatic vein was bridged and reconstructed by cadaveric common iliac artery allograft. OUTCOMES: The operation time was 480 minutes and warm ischemia time was 4 minutes. Blood loss was 300 mL without blood transfusion. The donor was discharged on postoperative day 7 uneventfully without complications. Literatures about laparoscopic living donor right hemihepatectomy  are compared and summarized in table. LESSONS: The total laparoscopic living donor right hemihepatectomy is technically feasible and safe in some transplant centers which should have rich open living donor liver transplantation experience and skilled laparoscopic techniques. Venous outflow tract reconstruction is necessary if orifice diameter of short hepatic vein is greater than 0.5 cm on the graft cutting surface.;;Li J, Huang J, Wu H, Zeng Y;;eng;['Adult', 'Cadaver', 'China', 'Hepatectomy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Iliac Artery/*surgery', 'Laparoscopy/*methods', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Operative Time'];;;;10.1097/MD.0000000000006167
1395;28187013;Article;2017;Transplantation;;The Effectiveness and Safety of Tranexamic Acid in Orthotopic Liver Transplantation Clinical Practice: A Propensity Score Matched Cohort Study.;;BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements during liver transplantation. However, clinical utilization is limited due to a perceived lack of generalizable effectiveness and concerns regarding its thromboembolic risks. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical use of TXA and to provide a pragmatic reappraisal of its effectiveness and safety. METHODS: After ethics approval, data were collected from 1799 consecutive liver transplant recipients between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2015, using retrospectively collected electronic databases. Propensity matching was used to account for confounders of  transfusion and thrombotic risk. Exposure was defined as a total TXA dose greater than 10 mg/kg for 50% of the operative duration. RESULTS: After propensity matching, 367 unique pairs were well balanced in terms of all measured covariates. In the matched pairs, patients exposed to TXA received less red blood cell (3 [0, 6] vs 4 [1, 7] P = 0.003) and frozen plasma (6 [2, 10] vs 6 [2, 12],  P = 0.032) transfusions. There were no differences in thromboembolic events between the groups (22 [6.0%] vs 36 [9.8%]). CONCLUSIONS: TXA appears effective in reducing red blood cell transfusion requirements without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events across a wide variety of liver transplant recipients, including those at low risk of bleeding or high risk of thromboembolic complications.

Ethical and Regulatory Issues Emerging from 3D Bioprinting in  Medicine.;;"Recent developments of three-dimensional printing of biomaterials (3D bioprinting) in medicine have been portrayed as demonstrating the potential to transform some medical treatments, including providing new responses to organ damage or organ failure. However, beyond the hype and before 3D bioprinted organs are ready to be transplanted into humans, several important ethical concerns and  regulatory questions need to be addressed. This article starts by raising general ethical concerns associated with the use of bioprinting in medicine, then it focuses on more particular ethical issues related to experimental testing on humans, and the lack of current international regulatory directives to guide these experiments. Accordingly, this article (1) considers whether there is a limit as to what should be bioprinted in medicine; (2) examines key risks of significant harm associated with testing 3D bioprinting for humans; (3) investigates the clinical trial paradigm used to test 3D bioprinting; (4) analyses ethical questions of irreversibility, loss of treatment opportunity and  replicability; (5) explores the current lack of a specific framework for the regulation and testing of 3D bioprinting treatments.";;Gilbert F, O'Connell CD, Mladenovska T, Dodds S;;eng;['*Bioethical Issues/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Bioprinting/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Ethical Analysis', '*Ethics, Research', 'Humans', 'Internationality', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Printing', 'Printing, Three-Dimensional/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Risk Assessment', '*Social Control, Formal', 'Tissue Engineering/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];['*3D printing', '*Bioprinting', '*Clinical trial', '*Ethical issues', '*FDA', '*Human experimental trials', '*Medical device', '*Organ', '*Personalised medicine', '*Regulation', '*Regulatory concerns', '*Risk of harm', '*Stem cells', '*TGA', '*Tissues engineering'];;DE150101390/Australian Research Council/International;10.1007/s11948-017-9874-6

The shortage of available organs for transplantation constitutes a universal problem, estimating that 10% of patients  on waiting lists die. Brain death is an undesirable result; nevertheless, it has  beneficial side-effects since it is the most frequent source of organs for transplantation. However, this phenomenon is relatively uncommon and has a limited potential. One of the options that focuses on increasing organ donation is to admit patients with catastrophic brain injuries (with a high probability of brain death and nontreatable) to the Intensive Care Unit, with the only purpose of donation. To perform elective nontherapeutic ventilation (ENTV), a patient's anticipated willingness to donate organs and/or explicit acceptance by his/her relatives is required. This process should focus exclusively on those patients with catastrophic brain injuries and imminent risk of death which, due to its acute damage, are not considered treatable. This article defends ENTV as an effective strategy to improve donation rate, analyzing its ethical and legal basis.";;Escudero D, Otero J, Menendez de Leon B, Perez-Basterrechea M;;eng;['Brain Death/legislation & jurisprudence/*physiopathology', 'Brain Injuries/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;The authors declare that they have no competing interests.;;10.1155/2017/7518375

1399;28178953;Article;2017;BMC medical ethics;;Human rights violations in organ procurement practice in China.;;BACKGROUND: Over 90% of the organs transplanted in China before 2010 were procured from prisoners. Although Chinese officials announced in December 2014 that the country would completely cease using organs harvested from prisoners, no regulatory adjustments or changes in China's organ donation laws followed. As a result, the use of prisoner organs remains legal in China if consent is obtained. DISCUSSION: We have collected and analysed available evidence on human rights violations in the organ procurement practice in China. We demonstrate that the practice not only violates international ethics standards, it is also associated  with a large scale neglect of fundamental human rights. This includes organ procurement without consent from prisoners or their families as well as procurement of organs from incompletely executed, still-living prisoners. The human rights critique of these practices will also address the specific situatedness of prisoners, often conditioned and traumatized by a cascade of human rights abuses in judicial structures. CONCLUSION: To end the unethical practice and the abuse associated with it, we suggest to inextricably bind the use of human organs procured in the Chinese transplant system to enacting Chinese legislation prohibiting the use of organs from executed prisoners and making explicit rules for law enforcement. Other than that, the international community  must cease to abet the continuation of the present system by demanding an authoritative ban on the use of organs from executed Chinese prisoners.;;Paul NW, Caplan A, Shapiro ME, Els C, Allison KC, Li H;;eng;['China', '*Human Rights/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Prisoners', '*Prisons', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Vulnerable Populations'];['China', 'Human rights', 'Medical ethics', 'Organ procurement', 'Prisoners'];;;10.1186/s12910-017-0169-x
1400;28165540;Article;2017;Swiss medical weekly;;Attitudes towards organ donation and relation to wish to donate posthumously.;;BACKGROUND: Organs donated for transplantation remain a scarce resource in Switzerland. One of the reasons for this situation is the high percentage of patients or families who refuse to consent to donation. This study aimed to provide an overview of attitudes towards organ donation among Swiss residents, including any intention to donate organs after death, and whether they had already declared their wish and/or communicated it to anyone. METHODS: A representative poll investigating the attitude of the Swiss population towards deceased organ donation was conducted between 16 and 28 March 2015. Survey data were collected in 1000 structured telephone interviews. Participants consisted of residents aged 15 years and over from all Swiss regions, and covering the German, French and Italian language areas. RESULTS: Of the 1000 survey participants, 92%  stated that they have a very positive (58%) or quite positive (33%) attitude towards organ donation, while 6% have a very negative (2%) or quite negative (4%) view. Some 81% of respondents said that they would be willing to donate their organs after death, and 9% expressed a wish not to become a donor. A total of 53% of participants said that they had already communicated or documented whether they wish to donate. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the importance of continuing to raise awareness about the importance of communicating wishes, both  in written form and to family members, and suggests that more work is needed to reap the benefits of the substantial support for organ donation among the Swiss population.;;Weiss J, Shaw D, Schober R, Abati V, Immer FF, Comite National du Don d'Organes Cndo;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Communication', 'Family', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Intention', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Switzerland', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.4414/smw.2017.14401
1401;28151810;Article;2017;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Are geographic differences in transplantation inherently wrong?;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Geographic variation in liver transplantation has been the subject of extensive scrutiny, reflecting concerns that location is unfairly determinative for people needing organ transplantation. Drawing upon a number of  established ethical approaches, we examine whether geographic differences in access to livers are inherently unethical. RECENT FINDINGS: We posit that the ethical imperative for redistribution largely hinges upon the belief that access  to organs systematically disadvantages certain identifiable groups of patients over others. Yet, our data suggest that regions likely to be net-contributors may suffer from less access to transplantation and other health services, fewer social protections and greater burden of liver disease. Drawing upon a number of  ethical approaches, including strict egalitarianism, utilitarianism, Maximin, Reciprocity, Sen's Impartial Spectator and a health equity framework, we demonstrate that the current proposal has significant weaknesses, and may not achieve its goals of improving equity and efficiency. SUMMARY: Formulating effective policies and programs to ameliorate health inequalities requires an understanding of the interrelated causes of mortality disparities and specific interventions to mitigate these causes. Although our analysis does not indicate how ethically distribute livers, but it suggests that this be done with consideration for population-based health measures.;;Ladin K, Hanto DW;;eng;['Geography', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*standards'];;;KL2 TR001063/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000400

This study aims to describe the perspectives of older kidney transplant recipients about their experience of kidney transplantation, self-management, and treatment goals to inform strategies and interventions that address their specific needs. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Face-to-face semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 kidney transplant recipients aged 65-80 years from five renal units in Australia. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: restoring vitality of youth (with subthemes of revived mindset for resilience, embracing enjoyment in life, drive for self-actualization); persisting through prolonged recovery (yielding to aging, accepting functional limitations, pushing the limit, enduring treatment responsibilities); imposing sicknesses (combatting devastating comorbidities, painful restrictions, emerging disillusionment, anxieties about accumulating side effects, consuming treatment burden); prioritizing graft survival (privileged with a miracle, negotiating risks for longevity, enacting a moral duty, preserving the last opportunity); confronting health deterioration (vulnerability and helplessness, narrowing focus to immediate concerns, uncertainty of survival); and value of existence (purpose through autonomy, refusing the burden  of futile treatment, staying alive by all means). CONCLUSIONS: Older kidney transplant recipients felt able to enjoy life and strived to live at their newly  re-established potential and capability, which motivated them to protect their graft. However, some felt constrained by slow recuperation and overwhelmed by unexpected comorbidities, medication-related side effects, and health decline. Our findings suggest the need to prepare and support older recipients for self-management responsibilities, clarify their expectations of post-transplant risks and outcomes, and provide assistance through prolonged recovery after kidney transplantation.";;Pinter J, Hanson CS, Chapman JR, Wong G, Craig JC, Schell JO, Tong A;;eng;['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*psychology', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Male', '*Patient Care Planning', 'Qualitative Research', 'Resilience, Psychological', '*Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Transplant Recipients/*psychology', 'Uncertainty'];['Australia', 'adolescent', 'aging', 'anxiety', 'cognition disorders', 'comorbidity', 'geriatric nephrology', 'goals', 'graft survival', 'humans', 'immunosuppression', 'kidney transplantation', 'longevity', 'medical futility', 'moral obligations', 'motivation', 'negotiating', 'quality of life', 'self-care', 'transplant outcomes', 'transplant recipients', 'uncertainty'];;;10.2215/CJN.05890616

We describe the justifications used in pediatric NSER narratives 2009-2014 and identify justifications associated with NSER denial, waitlist mortality, and transplant. Using United Network for Organ Sharing data, 1272 NSER narratives from 1138 children with NSERs were coded for analysis. The most common NSER justifications were failure-to-thrive (48%) and risk of death (40%); both associated with approval. Varices, involvement of another organ, impaired quality of life, and encephalopathy were justifications used more often in denied NSERs. Of the 25 most prevalent justifications, 60% were not associated with approval or denial. Waitlist mortality risk was increased when fluid overload or ""posttransplant complication outside standard criteria"" were cited and decreased when liver-related infection was noted. Transplant probability was increased when the narrative mentioned liver-related infections, and fluid overload for children <2 years old; it decreased when ""posttransplant complications outside standard criteria"" and primary sclerosing cholangitis were cited.

Phase I data from a series of EVNP in extended criteria donor kidneys have established the safety and feasibility of the technique in clinical practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a UK-based phase II multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of EVNP compared with the conventional static cold storage technique in donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplantation. 400 patients receiving a kidney from a DCD donor (categories III and IV, controlled) will be recruited into the study. On arrival at the transplant centre, kidneys will be randomised to receive either EVNP (n=200) or remain in static cold storage (n=200). Kidneys undergoing EVNP will be perfused with an oxygenated packed red cell solution at near body temperature for 60 min prior to transplantation. The primary outcome measure will be determined by rates of delayed graft function (DGF) defined as the need for dialysis in the first week post-transplant. Secondary outcome measures include incidences of primary non-function, the duration of DGF, functional DGF defined as <10% fall in serum creatinine for 3 consecutive days in the first week post-transplant, creatinine reduction ratio days 2 and 5, length of hospital stay, rates of biopsy-proven acute rejection, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1,  3, 6 and 12 months post-transplant and patient and allograft survival. The EVNP assessment score will be recorded and the level of fibrosis and inflammation will also be measured using tissue, blood and urine samples. Ethics and dissemination.

We hope to open a discussion regarding organ procurement from eligible donors in the prehospital and emergency department setting. CASE: This case study, involving an otherwise healthy man who, after suffering an untimely death, was able to successfully donate his organs, highlights the need to develop an infrastructure to make this type of donation a viable and streamlined option for the future. DISCUSSION: Given the departure from traditional practice in United States transplantation medicine, we bring forth legal and ethical considerations regarding organ donation in the emergency department. We hope that this case discussion inspires action and development in  the realm of transplant medicine, with the aim of honoring the wishes of donors and the families of those who wish to donate in a respectful way, while using our medical skills and technologies to afford candidates who are waiting for organs a second chance.

1406;28110028;Article;2017;International journal of surgery (London, England);;Surgical, ethical, and psychosocial considerations in human head transplantation.;;Transplanting a head and brain is perhaps the final frontier of organ transplantation. The goal of body-to-head transplantation (BHT) is to sustain the life of individuals who suffer from terminal disease, but whose head and brain are healthy. Ideally BHT could provide a lifesaving treatment for several conditions where none currently exists. BHT is no ordinary experiment, to transfer a head to another body involves extraordinarily complex medical challenges as well as ethical and existential dilemmas that were previously confined to the imagination of writers of fiction. The possibility of replacing an incurably ill body with a healthy one tests not only our surgical limits, but  also the social and psychological boundaries of physical life and alters what we  recognize life to be. The purpose of this target article, the complementary manuscript focused on immunological issues in BHT, and the accompanying Commentaries by scholars and practitioners in medicine, immunology, and bioethics is to review major surgical and psychosocial-ethical and immunological considerations surrounding body-to-head transplantation. We hope that together these ideas will provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the possibilities and challenges associated with BHT and initiate professional discussion and debate through which this new frontier in medicine is considered and approached.;;Furr A, Hardy MA, Barret JP, Barker JH;;eng;['Brain Tissue Transplantation/*ethics/psychology', 'Head/*surgery', 'Human Body', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/psychology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*ethics/psychology'];['Composite tissue allotransplantation', 'Ethics', 'Frontiers in surgery', 'Head transplantation', 'Vascularized composite allografts reconstructive transplant surgery'];;T32 HL007854/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.01.077
1407;28103829;Article;2017;BMC nephrology;;A comparison of the effects of oral vs. intravenous hydration on subclinical acute kidney injury in living kidney donors: a protocol of a randomised controlled trial.;;BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment for established renal failure is living donor kidney transplantation. However this pathway exposes healthy individuals to significant reduction in nephron mass via major surgical procedure. Laparoscopic  donor nephrectomy is now the most common method for live donor transplantation, reducing both donor post-operative pain and recovery time. However this procedure exposes kidneys to additional haemodynamic stresses. It has been suggested that donor hydration-particularly the use of preoperative intravenous fluids-may counteract these stresses, reducing subclinical acute kidney injury and ultimately improving long-term renal function. This may be important in both preservation of donor renal function and recipient graft longevity. METHODS/DESIGN: A prospective single-centre single-blinded randomized controlled  trial will be carried out to determine the effects of donor preoperative intravenous fluids. The primary outcome is donor subclinical acute kidney injury  (defined as plasma NGAL, >153 ng/ml) on day 1 postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include intraoperative haemodynamics, recipient subclinical acute kidney injury,  perioperative complications and donor sleep quality. Donors will be randomised into two groups: the intervention group will receive active pre-hydration consisting of three litres of intravenous Hartmann's solution between midnight and 8 am before morning kidney donation, while the control group will not receive this. Both groups will receive unlimited oral fluids until midnight, as is routine. Plasma NGAL will be measured at pre-specified perioperative time points, intraoperative haemodynamic data will be collected using non-invasive cardiac output monitoring and clinical notes will be used to obtain demographic and clinical data. The researcher will be blinded to the donor fluid hydration status. Blinded statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A prospective power calculation estimates a required sample size of 86 patients. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important data, as there is currently little evidence about the use of donor preoperative fluids in laparoscopic nephrectomy. It is hoped that the results obtained will guide future clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been approved by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 3 (reference no. 14/WS/1160, 27 January 2015) and is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (reference no.

They are also used for routine diagnostic purposes in human and veterinary medicine and for quality control procedures in the food-processing industry. The antibody is a major component of the detection system. It binds with the molecule to be identified. This conjugate is subsequently revealed by means of binding the antibody with a radio-isotope, a fluorescent substance, an enzyme inducing a color change, or a biosensor based analytical system. Polyclonal antibodies are also used for treatment purposes in various pathologies. They might have immunomodulating or anti-inflammatory properties. Snake venom, rabies and tetanus antisera are examples of a therapeutic application; immunosuppressive antithymocyte serum used in order to avoid rejection in organ transplantation is another example from human medicine. These  therapeutic aids need hyperimmunisation of animals. Since these are subject to a  certain number of interventions such as injections and blood samplings, animal welfare prescriptions have to be taken into account. The optimisation of the immunisation protocol allows for reducing the numbers of animals used as well as  reducing stress and pain while obtaining high quality antibodies.

METHODS: BALB/c mice were randomly divided into control, NS, HTS, and HES resuscitation groups. Three subgroups (n=8) in each resuscitation group were marked as 2, 24, and 72 h. Flow cytometry was used to detect the MDSCs, monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), and granulocytic/neutrophilic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) in peripheral blood nucleated cells (PBNCs), spleen single-cell suspension, and bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNCs). RESULTS: The MDSCs in BMNCs among three resuscitation groups were lower 2 h after shock, in PBNCs of the HTS group were higher, and in  spleen of the NS group were lower (all P<0.05 vs. control). The M-MDSC/G-MDSC ratios in PBNCs of the HTS and HES groups were lower (both P<0.05 vs. control). At 24 h, the MDSCs in PBNCs of the NS and HTS groups were higher, while the spleen MDSCs in the HTS group were higher (all P<0.05 vs. control). The M-MDSC/G-MDSC ratios were all less in PBNCs, spleen, and BMNCs of the NS and HTS  groups, and were lower in BMNCs of the HES group (all P<0.05 vs. control). At 72  h, the elevated MDSCs in PBNCs were presented in the HTS and HES groups, and in spleen the augment turned up in three resuscitation groups (all P<0.05 vs. control). The inclined ratios to M-MDSC were exhibited in spleen of the NS and HTS groups, and in PBNCs of the NS group; the inclination to G-MDSC in BMNCs was  shown in the HES group (all P<0.05 vs. control).

Although the infectious diseases data are limited and include mostly pretransplant serologies and other nonspecific infection-related outcomes, this multicenter data collection allows for insightful national data and the ability to monitor trends over time. We reviewed the published concise reports for each organ type in SRTR reports containing data from 2005 to 2014, and summarized our findings with respect to cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, general infection, and prophylaxis. Our review highlights a few developments. While rates of donor-recipient CMV serology combinations remain fairly constant over time, there are generally more seronegative donors and recipients among living donor transplants. There has been a reduction in PTLD for pediatric transplant recipients. There has also been a slight reduction in anti-HBV core antibody-positive donor organs and stable reporting of HCV-positive donor organs  and HIV-positive recipients.;;Kotton CN, Huprikar S, Kumar D;;eng;['Communicable Diseases/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Registries/*ethics', 'Risk Factors', '*Transplant Recipients'];['clinical research/practice', 'health services and outcomes research', 'infection and infectious agents', 'infectious disease', 'posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)', 'viral: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)', 'viral: cytomegalovirus (CMV)', 'viral: hepatitis', 'viral: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)'];;;10.1111/ajt.14195

METHODS: A principle-based normative analysis of potential common dilemmas in transnational eye banking activities was performed. RESULTS: Transnational activities in eye banking, like those in other fields involving procurement and use of medical products of human origin, may present a number of  ethical issues for policy makers and professionals. Key ethical concerns include  the potential impact of export or import activities on self-sufficiency of corneal tissue supply within exporting and importing countries; potential disclosure requirements when obtaining consent or authorization for ocular tissue donation when donations may be exported; and difficulties inherent in assuring equity in the allocation of tissues available for export and in establishing and  respecting standards of safety and quality across different jurisdictions.

1414;29746028;Article;2017;Clinical and experimental obstetrics & gynecology;;Low dose Cyclosporin A treatment increases live birth rate of unexplained recurrent abortion - initial cohort study.;;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy is similar to allogeneic transplantation. Eighty percent of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions (URSA) relate to disturbances of immune regulation. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a immunosuppressant widely used after organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune disease. Animal studies show that low dose of CsA could induce maternal-fetal immunity tolerance  while enhance trophoblast invasion. So far no clinical trial reported on the effect and safety of cyclosporin A treatment for URSA has been published. The objective of this study was to explore the effect, safety, and mechanism of low-dose CsA treatment in human patients in order to find a novel therapy to treat URSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients with eligible URSA treated at the clinic of the present hospital were included in this study from December 2009 to December 2012. The research was approved by the Ethics committee. Through a clinical study with prospective non-randomized controlled trials, the patients  were divided into CsA treatment group (n = 66 cases) and in control group (n = 20 cases) based on the patients' choice. Both groups started treatment as soon as the pregnancy test was positive. Patients in the treatment group were treated with oral CsA 100 mg/day for 30 days. Patients in the control group were treated  with progesterone 20 mg im per day until 12 weeks of gestation. Cytoimmunology test of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/8, CD4/25, CD19/21, and Th/Ts were examined before and after the treatment in both groups. Clinical consequences of mothers and fetuses  were followed up and recorded. Live birth rate and cytoimmunology markers and their change before and after the treatment were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The live birth rate was significantly higher in study group (41/66, 62.1%) than in the control group (6/20, 30.0%) (p < 0.001). There was no obvious side effect and adverse consequence in the pregnancy women. No IUGR or birth defect was observed in fetus in this study. After CsA treatment, CD3 level in maternal blood was higher in successful group than abortion group but CD8 level was decreased after CsA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose CsA treatment increases live birth rate of unexplained recurrent abortion. No maternal-fetal adverse consequence was observed in this study and it is safe in clinic use. The mechanism of CsA therapy may be related to immune regulation which may favor the success of pregnancy.;;Ling Y, Huang Y, Chen C, Mao J, Zhang H;;eng;['Abortion, Habitual/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Adult', 'Birth Rate', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Tests/methods', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;;
1415;28027062;Article;2017;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Organ donation and imminent death: pro position.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Donation after cardiac death is associated with many problems  including ischemic injury, high rates of delayed allograft function, prolonged time to asystole, and frequent organ discard. Imminent death donation (IDD) has been proposed as a separate category of organ donation: distinct from living donation and donation after cardiac death. RECENT FINDINGS: A protocol for IDD was developed at Rhode Island Hospital and published in the ethics literature. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Ethics Committee reviewed the protocol and stated that IDD was ethically appropriate in some cases. A wider review by a working group within UNOS concluded similarly, but felt that a myriad of policy revisions would be required and were concerned about a possible negative impact on public trust in organ donation. Nonetheless, IDD and other nontraditional strategies continue to be proposed, implemented in other countries and discussed by patients and donor families. SUMMARY: This review, on the 'Pro'  side of IDD, proposes that the medical community continue to work toward implementing IDD. Donor family's wishes are best met by organ donation, successful outcomes for the recipients, and a dignified death for their loved one. In some cases, IDD is the best strategy to meet these goals.;;Morrissey PE;;eng;['*Death', 'Humans', 'Terminal Care/*standards', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*standards'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000388

1419;27998333;Article;2017;Medical history;;Crossing the Rubicon: Death in 'The Year of the Transplant'.;;How death should be measured was a subject of intense debate during the late 1960s, and one in which transplant surgeons had a particular interest. Legislation required a doctor to first pronounce 'extinct' the patients from whom 'spare parts' were sought for grafting. But transplant surgeons increasingly argued the moment of death was less important than was the moment of establishing that a patient was beyond the point of no return in dying, at which time she or he should be passed to the transplant team. This raised concerns that people identified as being a potential source of organs might not be adequately cared for in their own right. In 1968 the World Medical Association issued an international statement on death at its meeting in Sydney, Australia following a  debate between delegates about how and by whom death should be assessed prior to  organ removal. Soon afterwards Australian surgeons performed two of the one hundred and five heart transplants carried out around the world that year, dubbed by the New York Times to be one during which an 'international epidemic' of such  grafts were carried out. This essay examines debates about death and transplanting, then analyses the pioneering Australian heart transplants, in the  context of the Declaration of Sydney and continuing international discussions about whether these operations were moral and legal.;;MacDonald H;;eng;['Australia', 'Brain Death/diagnosis', '*Death', 'Ethics, Medical/*history', 'Heart Transplantation/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans'];['Death', 'Declaration of Sydney', 'Harvard report', 'Heart transplantation', 'Medical ethics', 'World Medical Association'];;;10.1017/mdh.2016.103

Limited studies suggest that the survival of transplanted kidneys from donors expressing two APOL1 risk alleles is inferior to that of kidneys from donors with zero or one risk allele. In living kidney donation, two case reports describe donors expressing two APOL1 risk alleles who developed ESRD. Given the potential  impact of APOL1 variants on the utility and safety of kidney transplantation and  living kidney donation, the American Society of Transplantation convened a meeting with the goals of summarizing the current state of knowledge with respect to transplantation and APOL1, identifying knowledge gaps and studies to address these gaps, and considering approaches to integrating APOL1 into clinical practice. The authors recognize that current data are not sufficient to support traditional evidence-based guidelines but also recognize that it may require several years to generate the necessary data. Thus, approaches as to how APOL1 might currently be integrated into the clinical decision-making process were considered.

We have attempted to define groups of patients who may not have an option to wait for an allograft. These include kidney, heart, and lung candidates who are highly-allosensitized. In addition, some kidney candidates (who have previously lost at least 2 allografts from rapid recurrence of native kidney disease) have a high risk of further recurrence and will not be offered a repeat allotransplant. Patients with complex congenital heart disease, who may have undergone previous palliative surgical procedures, may be unsuitable for ventricular assist device implantation. Patients dying of fulminant hepatic failure, for whom no alternative therapy is available, may be candidates for a pig liver, even if only as a bridge until an allograft becomes available.

The other 62 (68%) did not meet eligibility screening. The major reason prospective donors were ineligible was that the recipient's household income was outside the required means test (ie, >300% of the federal poverty level) (n=51; 82%).

An Ethical Analysis of Allowing Families to Overrule Donation  Intentions.;;"Millions of people want to donate their organs after they die for transplantation, and many of them have registered their wish to do so or told their family and friends about their decision. For most of them, however, this wish is unlikely to be fulfilled, as only a small number of deaths (1% in the United Kingdom) occur in circumstances where the opportunity to donate organs is  possible. Even for those who do die in the ""right"" way and have recorded their wishes or live in a jurisdiction with a ""presumed consent"" system, donation often does not go ahead because of another issue: their families refuse to allow donation to proceed. In some jurisdictions, the rate of ""family overrule"" is over 10%. In this article, we provide a systematic ethical analysis of the family overrule of donation of solid organs by deceased patients, and examine arguments  both in favor of and against allowing relatives to ""veto"" the potential donor's intentions. First, we provide a brief review of the different consent systems in  various European countries, and the ramifications for family overrule. Next, we describe and discuss the arguments in favor of permitting donation intentions to  be overruled, and then the arguments against doing so. The ""pro"" arguments are: overrule minimises family distress and staff stress; families need to cooperate for donation to take place; families might have evidence regarding refusal; and failure to permit overrules could weaken trust in the donation system. The ""con""  arguments are: overrule violates the patient's wishes; the family is too distressed and will regret the decision; overruling harms other patients; and regulations prohibit overrule. We conclude with a general discussion and recommendations for dealing with families who wish to overrule donation.

Currently, management of patients with ACLF is mainly supportive. Despite medical progress, this syndrome frequently leads to multiorgan failure, sepsis, and, ultimately, death. The results of attempts to use liver transplantation (LT) to manage this critical condition have been poorly reported  but are promising. Currently, selection criteria of ACLF patients for LT, instructions for prioritization on the waiting list, and objective indicators for removal of ACLF patients from the waiting list in cases of clinical deterioration are poorly defined. Before potential changes can be implemented into decisional algorithms, their effects, either on the benefits to individual patients or on global transplant outcomes, should be carefully evaluated using objective longterm endpoints that take into account ethical considerations concerning LT.

1430;27607535;Article;2017;Transplantation;;Which Donor for Uterus Transplants: Brain-Dead Donor or Living Donor? A Systematic Review.;;BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate and compare the pros and cons of using living donors or brain-dead donors in uterus transplantation programs, 2 years after the first worldwide live birth after uterus transplantation. METHODS: The Medline database and the Central Cochrane Library were used to locate uterine transplantation studies carried out in human  or nonhuman primates. All types of articles (case reports, original studies, meta-analyses, reviews) in English or French were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Overall, 92 articles were screened and 44 were retained for review. Proof of concept for human uterine transplantation was demonstrated in 2014 with  a living donor. Compared with a brain-dead donor strategy, a living donor strategy offers greater possibilities for planning surgery and also decreases cold ischemia time, potentially translating into a higher success rate. However,  this approach poses ethical problems, given that the donor is exposed to surgery  risks but does not derive any direct benefit. A brain-dead donor strategy is more acceptable from an ethical viewpoint, but its feasibility is currently unproven,  potentially owing to a lack of compatible donors, and is associated with a longer cold ischemia time and a potentially higher rejection rate. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic review demonstrates that uterine transplantation is a major surgical innovation for the treatment of absolute uterine factor infertility. Living and brain-dead donor strategies are not mutually exclusive and, in view of the current scarcity of uterine grafts and the anticipated future rise in demand, both will probably be necessary.;;Lavoue V, Vigneau C, Duros S, Boudjema K, Leveque J, Piver P, Aubard Y, Gauthier T;;eng;['*Brain Death', '*Donor Selection/ethics', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/diagnosis/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Live Birth', '*Living Donors/ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/adverse effects/ethics/*methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*supply & distribution', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uterus/pathology/physiopathology/*transplantation'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000001481

METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted to assess the current state of penile reconstruction and transplantation options, as well as to evaluate scholarly research addressing the ethical dimensions of penile transplantation. RESULTS: The state of penile transplantation is elementary. If reconstruction is not a possibility, proceeding ethically with research on penile vascularized composite allotransplantation will require the articulation of guidelines. To date, very little has been published in the scholarly literature assessing the ethics of penile transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines should be developed to address penile transplantation and must cover the donation of tissue, consent, subject selection, qualifications of  the surgical team, and management of both failure and patient dissatisfaction. Unless guidelines are established and disseminated, penile transplants should not be undertaken.

1432;31037100;Article;2019;Journal of the Intensive Care Society;;Is presumed consent an ethically acceptable way of obtaining organs for transplant?;;The near-universal acceptance of cadaveric organ donation has been based on the provision of explicit consent by the donor while alive, either in the form of a formal opt-in or informal discussion of wishes with next of kin. Despite the success of transplantation programmes based on explicit consent, the ongoing imbalance between demand and supply of organs for transplantation has prompted calls for more widespread introduction of laws validating presumed consent with facility for opt-out as a means of increasing organ availability. The Department  of Health (UK) has recently concluded a consultation on the introduction of such  a law for England. This article explores the debate on presumed consent from an ethical point of view and summarises the key arguments on both sides of the ethical divide.;;Prabhu PK;;eng;;"['Presumed consent', 'ethics', 'ethics; clinical', 'ethics; transplantation', 'tissue and organ procurement']";;;10.1177/1751143718777171

The patients had a diagnosis of brain death,  were organ donors, and had no consent for the use of postmortem sperm. In Brazil, the diagnosis of brain death has been clearly established since 1997, with the most recent update in 2017, but has not considered the possibility of the collection of sperm or eggs from the donor.

The legality of human body transplants examined.;;In this article the authors examine the legality of human body transplantation under the current state of medical knowledge. The article first analyzes under what conditions an experimental medical procedure may be legitimately performed under international and national law. Then it examines the legal requirements for prior ethics approval and considers the possible civil and criminal liability claims and disciplinary sanctions that may arise if such a procedure would fail.  Subsequently, it applies this analysis to investigate whether body transplants would currently be legally allowed. The authors conclude that it is very unlikely that prior ethics approval would be obtained, and emphasize that physicians are likely to be found liable for medical malpractice if body transplantation is performed. If body transplantation results in the death of the patient, the physicians involved would run a considerable risk of being held criminally liable for negligent homicide. The participating physicians also risk severe disciplinary sanctions for professional misconduct, with a real possibility that  they will be suspended or even banned from medical practice for life.;;Van Assche K, Pascalev A;;eng;['Homicide', '*Human Body', 'Humans', 'Liability, Legal', '*Malpractice', '*Organ Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence', '*Physicians'];;;;
1436;30655131;Article;2019;Transplantation proceedings;;Ethical Issues in the Use of Suboptimal Kidneys for Transplants: An Italian Point of View.;;The shortage of organs leads to the need for utilizing suboptimal kidneys for transplantation. The distinction between optimal, marginal, and suboptimal kidneys leads surgeons to face not only technical problems but also ethical and legal issues related to clinical advantages offered by the transplant of a nonstandard kidney and the acquisition of consent. Between 1999 and 2015, we performed 658 transplants, 49 (7.5%) using suboptimal kidneys. All patients were  alive and with vital graft throughout follow-up. We did not encounter any major surgical complications. From a technical point of view, our experience and literature review confirm that transplant of suboptimal kidney leads to good clinical results but exposes patients to a increased risks of surgical complications. Therefore, these interventions must take place in hospitals fully  prepared for this type of surgery and performed by experienced transplant surgeons with proper matching between organ and recipient. Considering the insufficient resources available, from an ethical and legal point of view, doctors play an essential role in optimizing the use of these kidneys by avoiding wastage of organs, ensuring that transplants are done in suitable patients, and that patients are fully informed and aware of the risks and benefits associated with the specific suboptimal kidney being transplanted. We believe that, in highly specialized centers, the number of suboptimal kidney transplants should be increased, as their use has shown good clinical results and carries fewer ethical issues compared with marginal kidneys. Further, suboptimal kidneys may also be proposed for use in young patients with end-stage renal disease.;;Incollingo P, Peluso G, Pelosio L, Jamshidi AA, Montanaro V, Dodaro C, Vernillo A, Minieri G, Esposito A, Atontsa F, Capezzuoli L, Apostolico G, Menkulazi M, Paternoster M, Calogero A, Santangelo ML;;eng;['Adult', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Kidney/*abnormalities', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/*methods/mortality', 'Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Transplants/*abnormalities/*supply & distribution'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.05.031

METHODS: To identify where patients with an LVAD died, characterize QOL before death, and cause of death over time, we evaluated patients in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) implanted with a continuous-flow LVAD. RESULTS: From 18,733 patients implanted with an LVAD during the period 2008 to 2016, 4,916 patients were known to have died, of whom 98% had  a recorded location of death. Overall, 76.9% died in the hospital, with progressively more patients dying outside of the hospital further post-LVAD implant: <1 month, 2.3%; 1 to 12 months, and 16.8%; and >12 months, 37.4%. In a multivariable analysis, increased age (RR (risk ratio) 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.12, p=0.01) and destination therapy indication (RR 1.15,  95% CI 1.03 to 1.28, p=0.01) increased the likelihood of dying outside the hospital. Comparing 3 months post-implant with 6 months before death in a subset  of patients, QOL remained clinically stable (EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale [mean +/-  SD]: 68.3 +/- 22.2 to 66.7 +/- 21.7, p=0.11; KCCQ: 61.0 +/- 22.2 to 57.8 +/- 23.2, p=0.003). The most common cause of death <1 month post-implant was multiple-organ failure (20.4%) and at >1 month post-implant it was neurologic dysfunction (28.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with an LVAD died in the hospital. QOL remained stable months before death and causes of death were varied, but increasingly dominated by stroke. By understanding death with an LVAD in place, clinicians are in a better position to educate patients and caregivers  about what to expect and provide to support tailored to patient and caregiver needs.";;McIlvennan CK, Grady KL, Matlock DD, Helmkamp LJ, Abshire M, Allen LA;;eng;['Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/mortality/*surgery', '*Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', '*Registries', '*Terminal Care', 'United States'];['*end-of-life care', '*ethics', '*heart failure', '*heart-assist devices', '*palliative care'];;;10.1016/j.healun.2018.12.008
1438;30605440;Article;;The Journal of clinical ethics;;Justice and Respect for Autonomy: Jehovah's Witnesses and Kidney Transplant.;;"That Jehovah's Witnesses may refuse lifesaving blood transfusions is a morally accepted feature of contemporary medical practice. The principle of respect for autonomy supports this, and there is seldom reason to interfere with this choice  because it rarely harms another individual. Advances in surgical technique have made it possible for transplant surgeons to perform bloodless organ transplant, enabling Jehovah's Witnesses to benefit from this treatment. When the transplant  organ is a directed donation from a family member or friend, no ethical dilemma arises. However, when a Jehovah's Witness cannot identify a living donor and wishes to be listed for organ transplant, the transplant team may face an ethical dilemma. On the one hand, it wishes to provide care to the patient that is compatible with her or his preferences. On the other hand, the team may wonder if it is fair to other patients who need an organ and will accept blood transfusion  to include the Jehovah's Witness patient on a waiting list for a donated organ. If the Jehovah's Witness patient is listed and receives an organ, then a patient  who also needs an organ, and who is willing to accept all care to optimize the success of the transplant, may be denied an organ. To frame the ethical dilemma outlined above we present an anonymized case of a Jehovah's Witness woman in urgent need of a kidney, who was referred to one of the authors' institution's transplant center. We review the evolution of the Jehovah's Witness position on blood transfusion and the medical community's efforts to provide care that accommodates this religious commitment. If Witnesses are to be denied transplant  in the name of justice, there must be an ethically sound reason. We identify two  rationales in the literature: (1) this allocation is unacceptable because it will cost lives; (2) resources should be allocated to patients who comply with the standard of care. We argue that neither apply to this dilemma. We also emphasize  the importance of examining the data on outcomes of transplant with and without transfusion. Our interpretation of the published data on transplant without transfusion is that the outcomes are similar. We conclude that, in the absence of data that resources are risked, it is not ethical to refuse to include a Jehovah's Witness patient on a waiting list for an organ. Finally, we reflect on  the heterogeneity in transplant institutes' polices for accepting Jehovah's Witness patients.";;Cummins PJ, Nicoli F;;eng;"['Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'Humans', ""*Jehovah's Witnesses"", '*Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Religion and Medicine', 'Respect', 'Social Justice']";;;;
1439;30598488;Article;2018;BMJ open;;Rationale and design of TransplantLines: a prospective cohort study and biobank of solid organ transplant recipients.;;INTRODUCTION: In the past decades, short-term results after solid organ transplantation have markedly improved. Disappointingly, this has not been accompanied by parallel improvements in long-term outcomes after transplantation. To improve graft and recipient outcomes, identification of potentially modifiable risk factors and development of biomarkers are required. We provide the rationale and design of a large prospective cohort study of solid organ transplant recipients (TransplantLines). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TransplantLines is designed as a single-centre, prospective cohort study and biobank including all different  types of solid organ transplant recipients as well as living organ donors. Data will be collected from transplant candidates before transplantation, during transplantation, at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years, and subsequently every 5 years after transplantation. Data from living organ donors will be collected before donation, during donation, at 3 months, 1 year and 5 years after donation, and subsequently every 5 years. The primary outcomes are mortality and graft failure. The secondary outcomes will be cause-specific mortality, cause-specific graft failure and rejection. The tertiary outcomes will be other health problems, including diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular disease, and disturbances that relate to quality of life, that is, physical and psychological functioning, including quality of sleep, and neurological problems such as tremor and polyneuropathy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the relevant local ethics committee. The TransplantLines cohort study is designed to deliver pioneering insights into transplantation and donation outcomes. The study design  allows comprehensive data collection on perioperative care, nutrition, social and psychological functioning, and biochemical parameters. This may provide a rationale for future intervention strategies to more individualised, patient-centred transplant care and individualisation of treatment.

However, owing to the mismatch in demand and supply of the organ donors and recipients, donors after circulatory death (DCDDs) has increased recently all over the world. Kidneys, liver, and lungs are being used for transplantation from DCDDs. Recently, heart transplantation from DCDDs has been started, which is under the firestorm of scrutiny by the ethicists. The  ethical dilemma revolves around the question whether the donors are actually dead when they are declared dead by cardiocirculatory death criteria for organ procurement. The subsequent literature review addresses all the perspectives by differentiating between the donation methods known as DBDs and DCDDs, explaining  the implications of the dead-donor rule on the organ donation pool, and categorizing the determinants of death leading to separation of the arguments under the two methods of donations.;;Marsia S, Khan A, Khan M, Ahmed S, Hayat J, Minhas AMK, Mirza S, Asmi N, Constantin J;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Heart Transplantation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Brain death', 'Dead-donor rule', 'Donor after circulatory death', 'Heart transplantation', 'Organ procurement'];;;10.1016/j.ihj.2018.08.010

This opinion survey included a representative sample of 2000 participants in Morocco,  and data related to sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge and self-opinion  about organ donation, and reasons behind refusal were collected. Statistical analysis showed that 55.2% of the participants were women, the median age was 21  years, and 60.8% of included participants had secondary education. Almost two-thirds of surveyed participants (62.3%) showed a low to mid-level of knowledge about organ donation and transplantation in Morocco. About half of the  interviewed participants (48.8%) refused to donate their organs. Concern about risk of medical error and the belief in trafficking of procured organs were the main reasons for refusal, seen in 66% and 62% of the interviewees, respectively.  Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models showed that the older, the less educated and the less informed a person is, the less he accepted organ donation.

However, individuals meeting standard diagnostic criteria for brain death-unresponsiveness, brainstem areflexia, and apnea-are still living, from a physiological perspective. Therefore, removing vital organs from a heart-beating, mechanically ventilated donor is lethal. But neither donors nor surrogates nor the public in general are typically informed of this obviously relevant information. Therefore, donors or surrogates do not provide valid consent for a lethal medical procedure. This is a serious moral failing on the part of the transplant community. To address this concern, I advocate for accurate and fully transparent communication of information to the public to allow for an informed civic dialogue about the ethics and legality of lethal organ procurement.

The question of when to stop life support on a severely compromised patient was not clearly differentiated from the question of when someone was dead. A serious clinical problem arose when physicians realized that a patient's condition was hopeless but life support perpetuated body function. Thus, the committee stated that its first purpose was to deal with the burdens on patients and families as well as on hospitals and on patients needing hospital beds occupied by comatose patients. They intuited the strategy of ""defining"" these patients as dead, thus legitimating treatment stoppage. They noted that this would also serve a second purpose. Although the dead donor rule had not yet been clearly articulated, they  claimed that defining patients as dead would also address controversy over obtaining organs for transplant. My mentors' discussions related to my interest in the intersection between questions primarily of medical fact (When has a human brain irreversibly ceased functioning?) and nonmedical questions of social policy (Should we treat individuals with dead brains and beating hearts as dead humans?).

The possibility of employing animals as human ""matches"" sparks enthusiastic responses among researchers who imagine various creatures as  lucrative ""donor species"" or ""source animals"" whose organs might replace the failing parts of humans and render obsolete any future need for brain-dead donors. When we attend to how xenoscientists imagine the promissory qualities of  various species, we encounter a specialized logic of how and why one type of animal is valued over another. Well-established bioethical principles might assist us in framing our position in reference, say, to the limits of human suffering, or how to weigh the worth assigned to human versus animal lives, or how we conceive ""the quality of life."" But sadly, subjective experience can creep in to shape and cloud those very stances we regard as bioethically principled. Rather than pursue such a well-worn path, I suggest an alternative framework that privileges attentiveness to everyday thought and action over codified bioethics.  This framework-described as ""everyday"" or ""ordinary ethics"" in anthropology-involves assuming a critical, self-reflexive stance in reference to  quotidian ways of seeing and knowing. Like John Berger, who famously asked, ""Why  Look at Animals?,"" I ask, when we look at the lab-based baboon, chimp, or pig, what do we see?

1447;30584853;Article;2018;The Hastings Center report;;Conceptual Issues in DCDD Donor Death Determination.;;Despite the popularity, success, and growth of programs of organ donation after the circulatory determination of death (DCDD), a long-standing controversy persists over whether the organ donor is truly dead at the moment physicians declare death, usually following five minutes of circulatory and respiratory arrest. Advocates of the prevailing death determination standard claim that the donor is dead when declared because of permanent cessation of respiration and circulation. Critics of this standard argue that while the cessation of respiration and circulation may be permanent, it may not be irreversible at the moment death is declared because, if cardiopulmonary resuscitation were performed, it might succeed. And because irreversibility of cessation of respiration and circulation is required by both the statute and the biological concept of death, the donor must be alive. Who is correct? Making two related distinctions clarifies the cause of the disagreement over whether the DCDD donor  is dead and points to a possible resolution. First, in a determination of death,  there is an important distinction between the permanent and the irreversible cessation of circulation and respiration-two associated phenomena that are often  confounded. Second, there is an important distinction between the medical practice standard for death determination, in which physicians certify the permanent cessation of vital functions as sufficient for death declaration, and the underlying biological concept of death that requires the irreversible cessation of vital functions because death, by definition, is an irreversible event.;;Bernat JL;;eng;['Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Attitude to Death', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Brain Death/*diagnosis', '*Death', 'Humans', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/psychology/trends', 'Social Perception', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];;;;10.1002/hast.948

Yet brain death remains disputed as an acceptable definition within bioethics. The continuous debate among bioethicists has had three key recurring features: first and foremost, argument over alleged flaws in the conceptual logic and consistency of the ""whole-brain"" approach as a description of the meaning of  death; second, efforts to fix perceived limitations of brain death-based practices to optimize transplantation, especially given that transplantation was  the presumed original intended purpose of the definition; and third, a basic unease provoked by the experience of using the criteria and managing a body in this state of ""irreversible coma."" The third feature is the one I find the most compelling, though it is less explored, and it persists because of the failures of the prior two. Brain death remains strange-to medical personnel, families, philosophers. That is not because it hasn't yet been logically argued well enough or conceptually framed adequately, but because those things don't matter as much  to resolving this strangeness as the bioethical approach to brain death over the  last fifty years has assumed it does.

The DDR will be defined here as the prohibition against removal of organs necessary for the life of the patient-that is, the prohibition of intentionally ending the life of a patient through organ removal.  At a minimum, it is difficult not to see the DDR as grounded in a set of laws, norms, values, and practices that are firmly entrenched and have a great deal of  philosophical, religious, and legal support. Obviously, the primary argument against the DDR is that it is highly desirable that we continue to procure organs for transplantation, combined with the belief that those from whom we often and possibly typically procure organs are not ""really"" dead. If donors are not really dead, then we are left with a dilemma: either we abandon organ procurement, or we abandon the DDR.

Death determination, however, involves both discoveries of facts and events and decisions about their  meaning (whether the facts and events are relevant to establish a vital status),  the latter being subjected to legitimate disagreements requiring deliberation. By revisiting the historical origin of the dead donor rule, including some events that took place in France prior to the report by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain Death, I want to recall that those who first promoted the DDR did not take into account any scientific rationale to support the new proposed criteria to determine death.

While transplantation has been shown to be beneficial on an individual basis, the potentially poorer post-transplant outcome of these patients taken as a group can be held as an argument against allocating livers to them. Although this issue concerns only a minority of liver transplants, it calls into question the very heart of the allocation paradigms in place. Indeed, most allocation algorithms have been centered on prioritizing the sickest patients by  using the model for end-stage liver disease score. This has led to allocating increasing numbers of livers to increasingly critically ill patients without setting objective or consensual limits on how sick patients can be when they receive an organ. Today, finding robust criteria to deem certain cirrhotic patients too sick to be transplanted seems urgent in order to ensure the fairness of our organ allocation protocols. This review starts by fleshing out the argument that finding such criteria is essential. It examines five types of difficulties that have hindered the progress of recent literature on this issue and identifies various strategies that could be followed to move forward on this  topic, taking into account the recent discussion on acute on chronic liver failure. We move on to review the literature along four axes that could guide clinicians in their decision-making process regarding transplantation of critically ill cirrhotic patients.;;Artzner T, Michard B, Besch C, Levesque E, Faitot F;;eng;['Critical Illness/mortality/*therapy', 'End Stage Liver Disease/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/diagnosis/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*standards', 'Patient Selection/ethics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Resource Allocation/ethics/standards', 'Risk Assessment/standards', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*standards', 'Treatment Outcome'];['Acute on chronic liver failure', 'Cirrhosis', 'Critical', 'Ethical', 'Intensive', 'Intubation', 'Liver transplantation', 'Organ failure', 'Sepsis'];Conflict-of-interest statement: None of the authors declare conflicts of interest;;10.3748/wjg.v24.i46.5203

Dr Bramhall branded his initials on patients' livers during transplant surgery, behaviour acknowledged not to have caused his patients any harm by way of injury to their organs. Dr Bawa-Garba misdiagnosed and failed to properly assess a 6-year-old boy with pneumonia and sepsis under her care, who subsequently died. Taking account of contextual and public interest concerns, can and should there be exceptions to imposing criminal liability where a doctor's behaviour is deemed grossly negligent and a significant contribution to a patient's death? And is it really appropriate to subject a doctor to penal sanction where he may have committed a private wrong against a patient, but does not set back their interests?;;Ost S;;eng;['*Criminal Law', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Malpractice/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Physicians/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United Kingdom'];['*criminal law', '*legal philosophy', '*medical error'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2018-105135

1455;30577165;Article;2018;Transplantation proceedings;;Opinions of Health Care Personnel Regarding Disincentives and Incentives for Living Kidney Donation at a Single Center.;;BACKGROUND: Transplant societies continue to actively concentrate on increasing rates of living kidney donation (LKD) to bridge the gap between individuals awaiting transplantation and the number of kidneys available. A widely discussed  strategy to increase living donation rates is the provision of incentives and removal of disincentives. Though opinions of the public regarding this strategy have been studied, the opinions of health care providers, including younger professionals, are less clear. We studied the opinions of medical students and other health care providers on strategies to increase LKD to determine if opinions were different among those < 25 or >/= 25 years of age. METHODS: A simple cross-sectional survey was conducted at an academic medical center. Participants included medical students and employees in Internal Medicine, General Surgery, and the Organ Transplantation Center. Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact test were conducted on the responses regarding disincentives and incentives to determine whether opinions differed based on age. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty-four participants completed the survey. There was no statistical difference in opinions between groups on reimbursing transportation costs, loss of wages, or childcare costs, but those aged >/= 25 were more agreeable with covering food/lodging costs compared to those < 25 (96.5% vs 90.7%, P = .009). Respondents < 25 years old were more willing to donate a kidney for a financial incentive (P = .0002) accepting a median amount of $25,000. CONCLUSIONS: Health care personnel broadly support removing financial disincentives for living kidney donation, and those >/= 25 were more in favor of  covering food/lodging costs compared to those < 25. Those < 25 years old were more likely to accept financial incentives towards donating their kidney compared to those >/= 25 years.;;Story MT, Ten Eyck PP, Kuppachi S;;eng;['Adult', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/*ethics/supply & distribution', 'Male', '*Remuneration', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*methods', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.06.008

Although a basic consensus has been formed on the respect of autonomy in decision-making by  prospective donors regarding living kidney transplantation, concrete and practical measures at the clinical site are required to ensure donor autonomy. The aim of the study was to identify elements related to autonomy in the kidney donor decision-making process. METHODS: We systematically collected relevant studies from multiple databases in and out of Japan and conducted qualitative and inductive analyses. RESULTS: The identified elements were categorized into 12 subcategories and then regrouped into the following 4 categories based on the similarity of the contents: donor personality and values, inability to fully understand the implications of donation, possibility of direct pressure on donor's decision-making process, and donor's environment and situation. DISCUSSION: The autonomy-related elements were highly diverse, including obvious  pressure upon the donor and their values as well as influences from health care professionals. Some elements had room for change, such as the informed consent procedure, while some elements were unchangeable. Other elements were changeable  by intervention, but discussion is required about the appropriateness of the intervention itself. Further, a classification of clinical approach was suggested by the development of an analytical framework using 2 axes of ""site where the element arises"" and ""room for change"" based on the practical viewpoint of clinical circumstances.";;Arai N, Takimoto Y, Nakazawa E, Akabayashi A;;eng;['*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*psychology', 'Japan', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.06.015

Missing a potential donor leads to preventable  death and disability of transplant candidates and increased healthcare costs. METHODS: Stakeholders were invited to a national consensus conference on improving deceased organ donor identification and referral (ID&R) and healthcare  system accountability. In advance, participants received evidence-based, background documents addressing death audits, clinical triggers, required referral legislation, ethics, clinical pathways, and donation standards. At the conference, expert presentations and summaries of background information prepared by the Steering Committee informed group discussions of the preset questions. The conference's themes were: 1) expectations of potential donors, recipients and their families; 2) donor ID&R: clinical and legal perspectives; 3) enhancing accountability: gaps and solutions; and 4) enhancing accountability: quality/safety organizations. RESULTS: Thirty-seven consensus statements were generated. At the healthcare professional (HCP) level, key statements include: 1) donation be consistently addressed as part of end-of-life care but only after a decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment; 2) HCP know how and when to identify and refer potential donors; and 3) transplant candidates be informed of  local allocation guidelines and performance. At the healthcare system level, key  statements include: 1) national adoption of clinical criteria to trigger ID&R; 2) dedicated resources to match donation activities, including transfer of a potential donor; 3) performance measurement through death audits; 4) reporting and investigation of missed donation opportunities (MDO); 5) recognition of top performers; and 6) missed donor ID&R be considered a preventable and critical safety incident. CONCLUSION: Our consensus statements establish HCP and healthcare system responsibilities regarding potential organ donor ID&R and include the tracking, reviewing and elimination of MDO through system-wide death  audits. Once implemented, these consensus statements will help honour patients' wishes to donate, improve service to potential transplant recipients, and support HCPs in fulfilling their ethical and legal responsibilitites. Next steps include  implementation, assessment of their impact on donation rates, and investigation of new evidence-based targets for system improvement.";;Zavalkoff S, Shemie SD, Grimshaw JM, Chasse M, Squires JE, Linklater S, Appleby A, Hartell D, Lalani J, Lotherington K, Knoll G;;eng;['Canada', 'Death', '*Decision Making', 'Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration', 'Health Personnel/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Professional Role', 'Terminal Care/methods', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration'];;;TFU 127880/CIHR/Canada;10.1007/s12630-018-1252-6

Hepatitis C-seropositive liver grafts have been used primarily in hepatitis C-positive recipients, with studies  showing non-inferior outcomes when compared to hepatitis C-negative grafts. Studies suggest that hepatitis C serology status of the donor liver does not influence the patient or graft outcomes in the recipient. These results advocate  for offering hepatitis C-positive grafts to all patients awaiting liver transplantation regardless of their hepatitis C status. However, some concerns persist regarding the ethics of potentially introducing a new infection into a patient that could progress to chronic liver disease following liver transplantation. The recent approval of direct-acting antiviral therapy offers a  solution to this dilemma, as it has changed the landscape of hepatitis C management by making it a curable disease. In this review, we shall discuss the current evidence regarding the use of hepatitis C-seropositive donor grafts in hepatitis C-positive and hepatitis C-negative patients.;;Shetty A, Buch A, Saab S;;eng;['Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis C/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods/trends', '*Living Donors/supply & distribution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', '*Transplant Recipients', 'Transplants/drug effects/metabolism/*virology'];['*DAA, direct-acting antiviral', '*Donor grafts', '*Hepatitis C liver transplantation', '*Hepatitis C-positive donor grafts', '*Liver transplantation'];;;10.1007/s10620-018-5404-x

The debate is about Law no. 219, December 22, 2017 and on Law no. 222,  April 1, 1999. The quests are a) about the possibility to modify the first so that people deciding on how they want to die, may also decide about their willingness to allow the removal of their organs for transplantation and b) the possibility for donor families and recipients to have contacts after transplantation in the case both sides agree. Questions were emailed to the constitutionalist Francesco Paolo Casavola, immediate Past President of the National Committee for Bioethics, and to the philosophers Remo Bodei and Aldo Masullo. Their answers received by September 16, support the idea a) to include in the Law no. 219, 2017 the possibility to decide not only on the modality one wants to die but also on the possibility to allow his own organs to be removed for transplantation and b) to liberalize contacts between donor families and recipients when both side agree. For both changes there is enough evidence of their feasibility-necessity. The answers related to contacts between donor families and recipients support the decision of the National Committee for Bioethics on September 27, 2018.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study utilizing data from Swedish national health registers of patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Primary outcomes were renal disease-related healthcare resource  utilization and costs during the 5 years after transplantation. Secondary outcomes included total costs and loss of productivity. Regression analysis identified factors that influenced resource use, costs, and loss of productivity. RESULTS During the first year after transplantation, patients (N=3120) spent a mean of 25.7 days in hospital and made 21.6 outpatient visits; mean renal disease-related total cost was euro66,014. During the next 4 years, resource use  was approximately 70% (outpatient) to 80% (inpatient) lower, and costs were 75% lower. Before transplantation, 62.8% were on long-term sick leave, compared with  47.4% 2 years later. Higher resource use and costs were associated with age <10 years, female sex, graft from a deceased donor, prior hemodialysis, receipt of a  previous transplant, and presence of comorbidities. Higher levels of sick leave were associated with female sex, history of hemodialysis, and type 1 diabetes. Overall 5-year graft survival was 86.7% (95% CI 85.3-88.2%).

Little is known about factors influencing physicians' integration of APOL1 genetic testing of AA LDs into donor evaluation. DESIGN: We conducted a  cross-sectional survey, informed by Roger's Diffusion of Innovations theory, among nephrology and surgeon members of the American Society of Nephrology, American Society of Transplantation, and American Society of Transplant Surgeons  about their practices of and attitudes about APOL1 genetic testing of AA potential LDs. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 383 completed surveys, most physicians believed that APOL1 testing can help AA LDs make more informed donation decisions (87%), and the addition of  APOL1 testing offers better clinical information about AA LD's eligibility for donation than existing evaluation approaches (74%). Among respondents who evaluate LDs (n = 345), 63% would definitely or probably begin or continue using  APOL1 testing in the next year, however, few use APOL1 testing routinely (4%) or  on a case-by-case basis (14%). Most did not know the right clinical scenario to order APOL1 testing (59%), but would use educational materials to counsel AA LDs  about APOL1 testing (97%). DISCUSSION: Although physicians were highly supportive of APOL1 genetic testing for AA LDs, few physicians use APOL1 testing. As more physicians intend to use APOL1 testing, an ethical framework and clinical decision support are needed presently to assist clinicians in clarifying the proper indication of APOL1 genetic testing.;;Gordon EJ, Wicklund C, Lee J, Sharp RR, Friedewald J;;eng;"['Adult', 'African Americans/genetics', 'Aged', 'Apolipoprotein L1/*genetics', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Genetic Testing', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrologists', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Surgeons', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States', 'Young Adult']";['*African American', '*clinical practice', '*diffusion of innovations', '*ethics', '*genetic testing', '*health disparities', '*informed consent', '*kidney transplantation', '*living donation'];;R03 AI126090/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States;10.1177/1526924818817048

However, the risks of lifelong immunosuppression have limited these procedures to a select group of patients for whom nontransplant alternatives have resulted in unsatisfactory outcomes. Recent reports of facial allograft failure, and subsequent reconstruction using autologous tissues, have reinforced the idea that a surgical contingency plan must be in place in case this devastating complication occurs. Interestingly, backup plans in the setting of vascularized composite allotransplantation consist of the nontransplant alternatives that were deemed suboptimal in the first place. Moreover, these options may have been exhausted before transplantation, and may therefore be limited in the case of allograft loss or reamputation. In this article, the authors describe the surgical and nonsurgical alternatives to hand, face, penis, and lower extremity transplantation. In addition, the authors explore the ethical implications of approaching vascularized composite allotransplantation as a ""last resort"" or as a ""high-risk, improved-outcome"" procedure, focusing on whether nontransplant options eventually preclude vascularized composite allotransplantation, or whether vascularized composite allotransplantation limits future nontransplant reconstruction.";;Diaz-Siso JR, Borab ZM, Plana NM, Parent B, Stranix JT, Rodriguez ED;;eng;['Amputation/statistics & numerical data', 'Facial Transplantation/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/etiology', 'Hand Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression/adverse effects', 'Leg/*transplantation', 'Male', 'Penis/*transplantation', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation/*methods'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0000000000004855

1469;30474129;Article;2019;Bioethics;;Erosion of informed consent in U.S. research.;;This paper evaluates four recent randomized clinical trials in which the informed consent of participants was either not sought at all, or else was conducted with  critical information missing from the consent documents. As these studies have been taking place, various proposals to conduct randomized clinical trials without consent have been appearing in the medical literature. Some of the explanations offered for why it is appropriate to bypass consent or disclosure requirements appear to represent a fundamental misunderstanding of applicable government regulations and even the research enterprise. Others are the result of conceptual disagreements about the importance and application of traditional research ethics norms to 'comparative effectiveness research' and modern research environments. Common among these explanations, however, is a failure to appreciate when a research intervention, rather than merely an observation or review of data, is taking place. Review committees and investigators are failing  to see, or choosing to ignore, interventions in the lives of research subjects. When these studies have come to light, government agencies with oversight authority have done little or backed down. Prestigious medical journals have published research results knowing that the required consent was not obtained, or they have stood by the published studies even after the inadequacy of consent is  discovered.

We performed a multicenter study to determine associations between donor AKI (from none to severe based on AKI Network stages) and all-cause graft failure, adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient factors. We examined whether any of the following factors modified the relationship between donor AKI and graft survival: kidney donor profile index, cold ischemia time, donation after cardiac  death, expanded-criteria donation, kidney machine perfusion, donor-recipient gender combinations, or delayed graft function. We also evaluated the association between donor AKI and a 3-year composite outcome of all-cause graft failure or estimated glomerular filtration rate </= 20 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in a subcohort of 30% of recipients. Among 2,430 kidneys transplanted from 1,298 deceased donors, 585 (24%) were from donors with AKI. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there  were no significant differences in graft survival by donor AKI stage. We found no evidence that pre-specified variables modified the effect of donor AKI on graft survival. In the subcohort, donor AKI was not associated with the 3-year composite outcome.

Thirteen qualitative studies were reviewed, one of them used a mixed method. We found that individuals faced varied and complex situations differently while waiting for lung transplantations, depending on physical, psychological, social, and existential factors. Waiting gives hope for a future without the limitations imposed by the disease but also causes great stress. Many individuals struggled with the existential guilt associated with the privilege of having access to transplantation.

METHODS: Investigators from 67  Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study centers completed several questionnaires (response rate: 99%). RESULTS: Regarding practices around brain death, we found agreement on the clinical evaluation (prerequisites and neurological assessment) for brain  death determination (BDD) in 100% of the centers. However, ancillary tests were required for BDD in 64% of the centers. BDD for nondonor patients was deemed mandatory in 18% of the centers before withdrawing life-sustaining measures (LSM). Also, practices around postmortem organ donation varied. Organ donation after circulatory arrest was forbidden in 45% of the centers. When withdrawal of  LSM was contemplated, in 67% of centers the patients with a ventricular drain in  situ had this removed, either sometimes or all of the time. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed both agreement and some regional differences regarding practices around brain death and postmortem organ donation. We hope our results help quantify and understand potential differences, and provide impetus for current dialogs toward further harmonization of practices around brain death and postmortem organ donation.;;van Veen E, van der Jagt M, Cnossen MC, Maas AIR, de Beaufort ID, Menon DK, Citerio G, Stocchetti N, Rietdijk WJR, van Dijck JTJM, Kompanje EJO;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries, Traumatic/complications', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Internationality', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods', 'Trauma Centers/organization & administration'];['*Brain death', '*Ethics', '*Postmortem organ donation', '*Traumatic brain injury', '*Ventricular drainage', '*Withdrawing life-sustaining measures'];;NIHR-RP-R3-12-013/Department of Health/United Kingdom;10.1186/s13054-018-2241-4

It aims to offer a mechanism to decide the justifiability or unjustifiability of kidney sale in ethical terms. Tabataba'i considers ''Divine Consent'' as the criterion for the morality of an action. An action meets the ""Divine Consent"" requirement if it is done with a sincere intention, confirmed by reason and Divine revelations, brings about an internal peace for the agent, and preserves the agent's dignity and autonomy. Given this criterion and through an analytic and qualitative method, this paper aims to evaluate kidney sale in three cases: during one's lifetime, during brain death when the agent has left no will, and during brain death when the agent has left a will. It seems that, based on the theories of Tabataba'i, the above requirements are only met in the first two cases. Thus, kidney sale is morally justifiable in the first two cases but not in the third.";;Dehghan Simakani R;;eng;['Brain Death', '*Commodification', '*Ethical Analysis', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Iran', '*Islam', '*Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', '*Morals', 'Religion and Medicine', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/economics/ethics'];['Brain death', 'Divine consent', 'Ethics', 'Kidney sale'];;;10.1016/j.jflm.2018.10.009

In 2006, the MELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease), inspired by the U.S. model and based on the principle of need, was introduced in Brazil for liver transplant allocation. However, Brazil's inequalities have partially undermined the initiative's success. Other countries  have already benefited from growing discussion on the benefits of models that seek to harmonize utilitarianism and need.

However, despite numerous revisions, MELD allocation still does not allow for equitable access to all waitlisted candidates. An optimized prediction of mortality (OPOM) was developed (http://www.opom.online) utilizing machine-learning optimal classification tree models trained to predict  a candidate's 3-month waitlist mortality or removal utilizing the Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (STAR) dataset. The Liver Simulated Allocation Model (LSAM) was then used to compare OPOM to MELD-based allocation. Out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated for candidate groups of increasing disease severity. OPOM allocation, when compared to MELD, reduced mortality on average by 417.96 (406.8-428.4) deaths every year in LSAM analysis.  Improved survival was noted across all candidate demographics, diagnoses, and geographic regions. OPOM delivered a substantially higher AUC across all disease  severity groups. OPOM more accurately and objectively prioritizes candidates for  liver transplantation based on disease severity, allowing for more equitable allocation of livers with a resultant significant number of additional lives saved every year. These data demonstrate the potential of machine learning technology to help guide clinical practice, and potentially guide national policy.;;Bertsimas D, Kung J, Trichakis N, Wang Y, Hirose R, Vagefi PA;;eng;['Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/*mortality/surgery', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', '*Waiting Lists'];['*ethics and public policy', '*liver transplantation/hepatology', '*liver transplantation: auxiliary', '*simulation', '*statistics'];;;10.1111/ajt.15172

We could find scant literature about this unusual clinical circumstance, and therefore review pertinent aspects of renal disease in RA, perioperative medical management, maintenance of disease remission, outcomes for RA patients who have donated kidneys, and relevant ethical issues. Renal complications in RA are not uncommon, with as many as 50% of patients at risk of reduced eGFR. This reflects anti-rheumatic and analgetic medication use (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, DMARDs [cyclosporine and, historically, D-penicillamine and gold compounds], and others), glomerulitis, interstitial nephritis, complicating  Sjogren's syndrome, vasculitis, or amyloidosis, and/or emergence of an ""overlap""  syndrome or other rheumatic disorder. The literature suggests that MTX need not be interrupted for surgery. The risk of perioperative infection to our patient would be low and remission should be sustained. We are aware of one study of six  patients with RA who donated kidneys; they experienced no complications, ESRD, or deaths after a median follow-up of 8.2 years. Our ethical responsibilities are to balance patient autonomy of decision-making while assuring clinical beneficence and minimizing potential maleficence.

1477;30384800;Article;2019;Nursing ethics;;A care ethics approach to the Gender Kidney Donation Gap.;;Many studies have shown that women are more likely than men to be living kidney donors, and the discrepancy is particularly marked in heterosexual couples: wives are more likely than husbands to donate a kidney to their spouse. This 'Gender Kidney Donation Gap' can be understood in terms of Carol Gilligan's claims about  gender differences in ethical decision-making style, making it appropriate to analyse responses to this imbalance using an ethic of care. This article centres  the vast majority of living donors, those who donate in the context of a significant pre-existing relationship. A cost-neutral approach is unfair on donors who make society richer and healthier by helping a loved one. However, models of kidney sale fail to offer an acceptable alternative, either (a) compelling donors to sell into a pool where they do not know the recipient or (b) allowing affluent individuals unfair access to kidneys. Drawing on surrogacy law  in England and Wales, a model of compensation is proposed that includes a range of non-financial benefits. This option celebrates donation and expresses gratitude to all donors while avoiding the pitfalls of the marketplace, with an emphasis on fair treatment of donors. Nevertheless, if more generous treatment led to a 10% increase in directed donation, then it would be equivalent to doubling 'altruistic' stranger donations. As long as the Gender Kidney Donation Gap persists, the best response is to minimise the discomfort and disruption caused to donors by their profound act of kindness.;;Hodson N;;eng;['Adult', 'Altruism', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/economics/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Sexism/economics/*ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/methods/*standards/statistics & numerical data'];['Kidney donation', 'alternatives', 'care ethics', 'gender gap', 'kindness'];;;10.1177/0969733018806337

The OPTN's scope has grown steadily, and it now embraces several disparate missions: to operate the computing and coordination infrastructure that maintains waitlists and makes organ offers in priority order, to regulate transplant centers and organ procurement organizations, to follow and protect living donors, and to decide organ allocation policy in concert with the many voices of the transplant community. The contracting process and performance work  statement continue to discourage both innovative approaches to the OPTN and competitive bids outside of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), with evaluation criteria that either disqualify or strongly disadvantage new applicants. The performance work statement also emphasizes bureaucratic tasks while obligating the OPTN contractor to the specific committee structure that has impeded decision-making and tended to preserve the status quo in controversial matters. Finally, the UNOS computing infrastructure is antiquated and requires months to years to implement small changes.

According to data of the Italian Association for the donation of organs, tissues and cells (AIDO),  in 2017 in Campania Region (Southern Italy) an average of 12.5 people x1,000,000  donated their organs vs. a national average of 23.7. This negative discrepancy between national and regional data highlights that it is imperative to promote awareness-raising measures to address to the population of Campania Region in order to improve the following of a practice which is still object of preconceptions and scarce knowledge. This paper describes a pilot project started in 2017 by the ""Sportello amico trapianti"" (friendly access to transplantation) to promote the donation of organs within the university-hospital ""Federico II"" (Naples, Campania Region). The first phase of this project was based on the nudge theory, that is the ""little push"" to direct decisional processes of groups and individuals. This phase took place during the ""Atelier della salute"" (a health workshop), organized by the Medicine and Surgery school of the university-hospital ""Federico II"": here, a questionnaire was administered to 60 people. The questionnaire consisted in 12 questions, answered by volunteers, which aim was to test the general knowledge about organ donation and transplantation. Analysing the answers, a panel of 7 experts (2 epidemiologists,  1 social worker, 2 experts in public and institutional communication, 1 biologist expert in donation of haematopoietic progenitor cell, 1 transplant surgeon), responsible for the coordination and monitoring of the activities, identified the critical elements to bring attention to in order to raise awareness in the population. The second phase consisted in a literary workshop which aim was to identify nudge cases. The text used was Never let me go by Kazuo Ishiguro, a novel focused on organ donation in a dystopic context where the protagonists are  clones created to facilitate the donation of organs. Six students participated in this workshop: all six considered the dystopic scenario as a potential nudge to humanize the approach to organ donation and transplant. In conclusion, we believe that the nudge methodology may be used in order to improve awareness and adherence to donation of organs.";;De Pascale T, Alfano R, Barbieri O, Carannante I, Marra F, Schiavone D, Gentile L, Castrianni D, D'Onofrio G, Buonocore G, Passione A, Santangelo M, Triassi M, Rubba F;;ita;['*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Narrative Medicine', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Students', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.19191/EP18.5-6.P364.106
1480;30360961;Article;2018;American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation;;African American Living Donors' Attitudes About APOL1 Genetic Testing: A Mixed Methods Study.;;"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: African American live kidney donors (""donors"") have a greater risk for kidney failure than European American donors. Apolipoprotein L1  gene (APOL1) variants in African Americans may be associated with this disparity. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional mixed-methods design. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: African American donors at 1 transplantation center. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Semistructured interviews assessed attitudes about APOL1 genetic testing, willingness to undergo APOL1 testing, hypothetical decisions about donating with  2 APOL1 variants, and demographics. Surveys assessed perceptions of ethnic identity and genetics knowledge. Interview transcriptions were analyzed using thematic analysis. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 23 donors participated in semistructured interviews. Most (96%) reported that transplantation centers should routinely offer APOL1 genetic testing to all  African American potential donors. Most (87%) would have been willing to undergo  APOL1 testing before donating. Although study participants noted that APOL1 testing may deter African American potential donors from donating, most (61%) would have donated even if they had 2 high-risk APOL1 variants. Several themes emerged. Study participants believed that APOL1 testing was beneficial for providing information to help donors make informed donation decisions. Participants expressed concern about APOL1 variants placing donors at harm for kidney failure, and therefore valued taking preventive health measures. Participants believed that potential donors would experience psychological distress from learning that they have 2 gene variants and could harm their recipients. Participants were apprehensive about insurance coverage and costs of  APOL1 testing and feared that APOL1 genetic test results could discriminate against African Americans. LIMITATIONS: Findings may not be generalizable to African American potential donors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that African American donors support APOL1 genetic testing yet fear that APOL1 variants and genetic testing could adversely affect donors' health and ethnic identity. Transplantation centers using APOL1 genetic testing should address African American donors' concerns about APOL1 genetic testing to optimize future donors'  informed consent practices.";;Gordon EJ, Amomicronrtegui D, Blancas I, Wicklund C, Friedewald J, Sharp RR;;eng;['Adult', 'African Americans/*genetics', 'Apolipoprotein L1/*genetics', 'Attitude to Health', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing/methods', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Safety/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['*African American', '*apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1)', '*cultural identity', '*ethics', '*ethnicity', '*genetic testing', '*health disparities', '*informed consent', '*kidney transplantation', '*living donation', '*medical decision making', '*qualitative research', '*sociocultural'];;R03 AI126090/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States;10.1053/j.ajkd.2018.07.017

The procedural stages included initial instrumentation for intra-operative monitoring, laparoscopic nephrectomy, preparation of the kidney graft, orthotopic auto-transplantation by  either a laparoscopic approach or an open surgical approach, and ligation of the  contralateral ureter. During the evolution and establishment of this pig model multiple refinements were introduced: (1) a heat pad was changed to a circulating warm air blanket; (2) routine administration of anticholinesterase and antimuscarinic drugs for reversal of neuromuscular blockade; (3) a technique for  urethral catheterisation was developed; (4) ultrasound guidance for placement of  a central venous line was learned; (5) intravenous infusions of morphine and ketamine were instituted for a more stable and balanced anaesthetic protocol; and (6) post-operative monitoring was performed by two technical staff for at least the first six hours after extubation of the trachea. The combination of refinements to the anaesthesia protocol for laparoscopic orthotopic kidney auto-transplantation over the first 54 pigs has translated to improved outcomes.

This study will evaluate whether a video clinic implemented at the University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust improves patient satisfaction compared to standard face-to-face appointments for liver transplant  patients. METHODS: This will be a parallel, two-arm, statistician-blinded, randomised evaluation. Clinically stable liver patients at 1 to 5 years post-transplant (n = 180) will be randomised in equal numbers to video clinic appointments (intervention) or standard face-to-face appointments (control). The  intervention group will have outpatient appointments from home via a secure video link accessed through the UHB patient portal. All patients will complete baseline questionnaires before randomisation and electronic follow-up questionnaires after each follow-up appointment during the subsequent 12 months. The primary outcome is the difference in scores between groups for three domains of patient satisfaction, namely 'convenience of location', 'getting through to the office by phone' and 'length of time waiting' (modified Visit-Specific Satisfaction Instrument). Secondary outcomes include quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L), costs, clinical contacts and user experience. Statistical analysis will be descriptive and performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome will be analysed using baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month questionnaires (according to  patient follow-up appointment frequency) and comparisons made between study arms. A within-trial cost consequences analysis will be undertaken on the economic data. Patients (n = 8), carers/family members (n = 6) and health professionals (n = 14) will be interviewed about the experience of video clinics and the interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will  allow an in depth understanding of whether video clinics can improve patient satisfaction with their care. In addition, the intervention could save patients time and costs, removing the need to travel long distances for outpatient appointments. Video clinics may be applicable to a wide range of other clinical settings and health conditions.

Nevertheless, donor organs are a scarce resource resulting  in a large mismatch between supply and demand. Therefore, priority-setting leads  to the dilemma of how these scarce organs should be allocated and who should be considered eligible to receive a suitable organ. In order to improve the supply-demand mismatch in transplantation medicine, this study explores preferences of different stakeholders (general public, medical professionals and  patients) for the allocation of donor organs for transplantation in Germany. The  aims are (1) to determine criteria and preferences, which are relevant for the allocation of scarce donor organs and (2) to compare the results between the three target groups to derive strategies for health policy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We outline the study protocol for discrete choice experiments, where respondents  are presented with different choices including attributes with varied attribute levels. They were asked to choose between these choice sets. First, systematic reviews will be conducted to identify the state of art. Subsequently, focus group discussions with the public and patients as well as expert interviews with medical professionals will follow to establish the attributes that are going to be included in the experiments and to verify the results of the systematic reviews. Using this qualitative exploratory work, discrete choice studies will be designed to quantitatively assess preferences. We will use a D-efficient fractional factorial design to survey a total sample of 600 respondents according to the public, medical professionals and patients each. Multinomial conditional logit model and latent class model will be analysed to estimate the final results.

Why Biosimilars are not the Solution.;;"Advancements in the field of biotechnology have accelerated the development of drugs that are manufactured from cultures of living cells, commonly referred to as ""biologics."" Due to the complexity of the production process, generic biologics are unlikely to be chemically identical to the reference product, and accordingly are referred to as ""biosimilars."" Encouraging the development of biosimilars has been presented as the key solution to decrease prices and increase access to biologics, but the development and use of biosimilars continues to raise problems, none of which can easily be addressed. Developing a  biosimilar requires considerable time and financial resources, and legitimate safety concerns necessitate elaborate clinical testing of biosimilars. As a consequence, the introduction of biosimilars onto the market has not resulted in  significant price reductions, and concerns regarding the substitution and interchangeability of original biologics with biosimilars persist. This article will explain how the biologics production process distorts the trade-offs that traditionally guided both patent protection and regulatory exclusivities: disclosure as a key condition for benefiting from the corresponding monopoly position. Hence, we propose establishing a mechanism of mandatory deposit of the  original biologic's cell line at the stage of the regulatory approval as the most effective remedy.";;Diependaele L, Cockbain J, Sterckx S;;eng;['*Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Drug Approval', 'Drug Industry', 'Drugs, Generic', 'Economic Competition', 'Humans', 'Ownership/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patents as Topic', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration'];;;;10.1177/1073110518804241

Over the last half-century, immunosuppressive drugs have extended the lives of transplant patients worldwide. However, the use of animal models in the development of these drugs is not perfect, and this has brought to light a number of issues including  idiosyncratic reactions that are found in animal models but not in humans. The 2006 highly publicized case of the 'elephant man' TGN 1412 drug trial highlights  the importance of being cogent of the limitations of animal models. Areas covered: This review covers the utility and limitations of the use of animal models for the development of immunosuppressant agents. This includes both large  and small animal models, particularly rodent models in the transplant setting. Expert opinion: The use of animal models represents a critical stage in the development of immunosuppressive drugs. Limitations include physiological differences to humans; this is especially true of immunologically naive lab rodents with small memory cell populations. Toxic drug levels may differ widely between species. Animal models are also costly and raise ethical concerns.

We  tested the hypothesis that wellbeing and medication adherence are associated with psychosocial factors. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey for young adults on KRT. Additional clinical information was obtained from the UK Renal Registry. We compared outcomes by treatment modality using age- and sex-adjusted regression models, having applied  survey weights to account for response bias by sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic  status. We used multivariable linear regression to examine psychosocial associations with scores on the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale and the  eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. RESULTS: We recruited 976 young adults and 64% responded to the survey; 417 (71%) with transplants and 173 (29%)  on dialysis. Wellbeing was positively associated with extraversion, openness, independence, and social support, and negatively associated with neuroticism, negative body image, stigma, psychologic morbidity, and dialysis. Higher medication adherence was associated with living with parents, conscientiousness,  physician access satisfaction, patient activation, age, and male sex, and lower adherence was associated with comorbidity, dialysis, education, ethnicity, and psychologic morbidity.

1487;30326848;Article;2018;BMC nephrology;;Renal transplantation in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome: should we?;;BACKGROUND: Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) Syndrome is a rare genodermatosis caused by a mutation on folliculin gene, with a strong link to renal cancer. To date few patients with such condition have reached dialysis stage, as nephron-sparing surgery is usually possible at the time of diagnosis. To our best knowledge no patient with BHD syndrome has been submitted to renal transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a woman diagnosed with multifocal bilateral renal cell carcinoma that underwent bilateral radical nephrectomy and was started on a regular hemodialysis program at the age of 29. While on hemodialysis program she was diagnosed clinically with BHD syndrome and molecular testing confirmed an heterozygous mutation on FLCN gene. The patient has been kept on surveillance program for 2 years with no clinical complications from the genetic syndrome and  in complete remission from renal cancer. Though there has not been any report of  a patient with BHD being transplanted, risks and benefits for this patient were weighted. She has been considered apt by the transplant team and is currently waitlisted for cadaveric renal transplantation. DISCUSSION: It is a matter of discussion which should be cancer-free period for anephric patients with an inherited cancer syndrome to be candidates for renal transplant. So far BHD syndrome has not been causally associated with any other neoplastic disorder elsewhere.

Some might think that we should embrace such transplants as one more way to assist people to have  children. However, in this paper I argue that uterus transplants are not something that we ought to fund, nor something that we should make easy to access. First, I argue that any justification of providing uterus transplants must be based on the value of the experience of gestation, rather than on claims  of meeting medical need or promoting normal functioning. Second, I demonstrate that such a justification has limited prospects of success. The value of experiencing gestation is unlikely to be sufficient to justify state funding of uterus transplants and, further, we have reason to refrain from enabling such transplants.;;McTernan E;;eng;['Female', 'Financing, Government', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*therapy', 'Organ Transplantation/economics/*ethics', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*ethics', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['*assisted reproductive technologies', '*fertility treatment', '*pregnancy', '*uterus transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12523

1490;30318618;Article;2018;Bioethics;;Pushing the boundaries: Uterine transplantation and the limits of reproductive autonomy.;;Over the course of recent years, various scientific advances in the realm of reproduction have changed the reproductive landscape, enhancing women's procreative rights and the choices available to them. Uterus transplants (UTx) are the latest of such medical innovations aimed at restoring fertility in women  suffering from absolute uterine factor infertility, providing them with the possibility not only of conceiving a genetically related child but also of gestating their own pregnancies. This paper critically examines the primacy of reproductive liberty in the context of uterus transplantation. It questions whether and to what extent we should respect the reproductive autonomy of a woman who chooses UTx, given the significant risks that attach to the procedure and existing concerns that UTx may perpetuate potentially troubling gendered norms surrounding pregnancy and the role of women's bodies in reproduction, which may place undue reproductive pressures on women.;;O'Donovan L;;eng;"['Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*therapy', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', '*Personal Autonomy', 'Pregnancy', '*Reproductive Rights', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*ethics', 'Uterus/*transplantation', ""*Women's Rights""]";['*absolute uterine factor infertility', '*assisted reproduction', '*reproductive autonomy', '*reproductive technologies', '*uterine transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12531

1492;30279107;Article;2019;Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS;;The Helsinki approach to face transplantation.;;AIM: We herein describe the establishment of the Helsinki Vascularized Composite  Allotransplantation (VCA) program and its execution in the first two face transplant cases. METHODS & PATIENTS: The Helsinki VCA program initially required the fulfillment of legal, hospital, financial, and ethical requirements. Thereafter, the assembling of a multidisciplinary team commenced. A team of Plastic, maxillofacial and ENT surgeons comprise the facial VCA team. The protocol involves collaboration with the Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) team, transplant immunology, immunosuppression, microbiology, psychiatric evaluation, well-defined VCA indications and informed consent. Between 2011 and 2017 two patients were selected for transplantation. Both patients had a severe composite  facial deformity involving the maxilla and mandible following earlier ballistic injury. RESULTS: Patient 1 was a 35 year-old male who underwent successful near total face transplantation in February 2016 and at 30 months he has a good aesthetic outcome with symmetrical restoration of the central face and good sensory and symmetrical motor functional outcomes. Patient 2 was a 58 year-old male who underwent full face transplantation in March 2018 and at 5 months he has recovered without major problems. CONCLUSION: A successful facial VCA program requires a well-prepared research protocol, experts from multiple specialties and careful patient selection. The establishment of the Helsinki VCA program required long and thorough planning and resulted in the first two Nordic face transplantation cases. This protocol now forms the platform (as a proof of concept) for other types of vascularized composite allotransplantations.;;Lindford AJ, Makisalo H, Jalanko H, Lauronen J, Anttila VJ, Juteau S, Ammala AJ, Eskola A, Saarni S, Isoniemi H, Makitie A, Lassus P;;eng;['Adult', 'Algorithms', '*Facial Transplantation', 'Finland', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Care Team/economics/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration', 'Treatment Outcome'];['*Facial allotransplantation', '*Facial transplantation', '*VCA program'];;;10.1016/j.bjps.2018.08.030

1494;30255133;Article;2018;Transplantation direct;;Procurement Biopsy Findings Versus Kidney Donor Risk Index for Predicting Renal Allograft Survival.;;"Background: Efforts to maximize transplantation by matching organ quality to recipient longevity require reliable tools. The US kidney allocation system uses  the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) for this purpose, and many centers additionally rely on donor biopsies. The Leuven score combines donor age with procurement histology (glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy) to predict allograft survival. Methods: We compared KDRI with Leuven scores for associations with kidney discard, delayed graft function, and allograft function and survival. We used Cox, modified Poisson, and linear regression to calculate risks based on KDRI and (separately) Leuven scores, adjusting for important transplant and recipient variables. Results: From 890 donors, 1729 kidneys were procured and biopsied. Five hundred eighty-five (34%) kidneys were discarded. Median donor age was 53 years (interquartile range [IQR], 44-61 years). Median KDRI and Leuven scores were 1.56 (IQR, 1.28-1.90) and 59 (IQR, 49-69). Relative risk for discard was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.24) per 0.2-unit increase in KDRI and 1.38 (1.31-1.46) per 10-unit increase in Leuven score. Adjusted relative risks for delayed graft function were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94-1.02) and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.99), adjusted hazard ratios for graft failure were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.16) and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.21), and adjusted linear regression coefficients for 3-year estimated glomerular filtration rate were -3.88 (-4.63 to -3.13) and -5.18 (-6.19 to -4.18). Conclusions: In kidneys clinically selected for procurement biopsy, the Leuven score was more strongly associated with discard but performed similarly to KDRI for predicting transplant outcomes, suggesting the need to reevaluate current procurement biopsy practices. Given modest associations for both tools; however,  neither KDRI nor the Leuven score should be used in isolation for individual organ acceptance decisions.";;Hall IE, Parikh CR, Schroppel B, Weng FL, Jia Y, Thiessen-Philbrook H, Reese PP, Doshi MD;;eng;;;The authors declare no conflicts of interest.;K24 DK090203/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/TXD.0000000000000816

The factors associated with multiple listing and whether multiple listing modifies waitlist mortality or likelihood of lung transplant is unknown. US lung transplant waitlist candidates were identified as either single or multiple listed using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Characteristics of single and multiple listed  candidates were compared and multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations with multiple listing. Multiple listed candidates were matched to single listed candidates using a combination of exact and propensity score matching methods. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the  relationship of multiple listing on waitlist mortality and receiving a transplant. Multiple listing occurred in 2.3% of lung transplant waitlist candidates. Younger age, female gender, white race, short stature, high antibody  sensitization, college or postcollege education, lower lung allocation score, and a cystic fibrosis diagnosis were independently associated with multiple listing.  Multiple listing was associated with an increased likelihood of lung transplant (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.74, 95% CI 2.37 to 3.16) but was not associated with waitlist mortality (aHR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.44).;;Mooney JJ, Yang L, Hedlin H, Mohabir P, Dhillon GS;;eng;['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', '*Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Waiting Lists'];['*clinical research/practice', '*disparities', '*ethics and public policy', '*lung disease', '*lung transplantation/pulmonology', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*registry/registry analysis', '*waitlist management'];;KL2 TR001083/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.15124

This trend is gathering momentum in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care given evident  care gaps and the variety of healthcare entities that touch patients with ESRD in the course of their treatment. Although care models supported by chronic condition special needs plans and ESRD seamless care organizations (ESCOs) have advanced care and cost-effectiveness, their shortcomings limit their ability to support larger patient populations. New care models and potential organizational  structures, such as those proposed in the Dialysis Patient Access To Integrated-care, Empowerment, Nephrologists, Treatments, and Services (PATIENTS)  Demonstration Act, provide another approach toward reducing fragmentation of care, increasing patient health, and helping define better approaches to care for patients with ESRD so that they have the opportunity to be better transplant candidates. We recognize that this type of innovation represents change without certainty. We also believe that multiple levels of accountability, ongoing support for transplantation, and continued freedom of access to transplant professionals who participate in Medicare would prioritize patient health, quality of life, and choice with regard to transplantation with this care model.;;Becker BN, Nissenson AR;;eng;['*Health Priorities', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Renal Dialysis', 'United States'];['*dialysis', '*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics and public policy', '*insurance - public', '*kidney disease', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology'];;;10.1111/ajt.15128

Given the importance of long-term graft survival for paediatric recipients, consideration is now being given to kidneys from small paediatric donors (SPDs).  There exist a lack of consensus and a reluctance amongst some centres in transplanting SPDs due to high surgical complication rates, graft loss and concerns regarding low nephron mass and long-term function. The aim of this review is to examine and present the evidence base regarding the transplantation  of these organs. The literature in both the paediatric and adult renal transplant fields, as well as recent relevant conference proceedings, is reviewed. We discuss the surgical techniques, long-term graft function and rates of complications following transplantation of SPDs. We compare graft survival of SPDs to adult deceased donors and consider the use of small paediatric donors after circulatory death (DCD) organs. In conclusion, evidence is presented that may refute historically held paradigms regarding the transplantation of SPDs in paediatric recipients, thereby potentially allowing significant expansion of the  donor pool.;;Damji S, Callaghan CJ, Loukopoulos I, Kessaris N, Stojanovic J, Marks SD, Mamode N;;eng;['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Allografts/anatomy & histology/physiology/*supply & distribution', 'Child', 'Consensus', 'Donor Selection/ethics/*standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Graft Survival/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/anatomy & histology/physiology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*methods/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Organ Size', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];['*Donation after circulatory death', '*En bloc', '*Graft survival', '*Kidney transplantation', '*Paediatric donor', '*Thrombosis'];;DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom;10.1007/s00467-018-4073-5

C-peptide data from seven participating  centers (n = 415 graft failures for transplants performed from 2002 to 2012) were analyzed pretransplant, at graft failure, and at return to insulin. One hundred forty-nine C-peptide values were submitted at pretransplant, 94 at return to insulin, and 233 at graft failure. There were 77 transplants with two available values (at pretransplant and at graft failure). For recipients in the study with  pretransplant C-peptide <0.75 ng/mL who had a posttransplant C-peptide value available (n = 61), graft failure was declared at varying levels of C-peptide. High C-peptide values at graft failure were not explained by nonfasting testing or by individual center bias. Transplant centers declare pancreas graft failure at varying levels of C-peptide and do not consistently report C-peptide data. Until February 28, 2018, OPTN did not require reporting of posttransplant C-peptide levels and it appears that C-peptide levels are not consistently used for evaluating graft function.

In such cases, we suspect that donor advocates either do not approve the potential donor for transplantation or simply remain neutral.

METHODS: In this exploratory study, we used survey instruments and qualitative interviews to characterize nonmedical outcomes among  individuals turned down for living kidney donation between July 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. We assembled a comparator group of kidney donors. RESULTS: Among 83 turned-down donors with contact information at a single center, 43 (52%) participated in the study (median age 53 years; 53% female; 19% black). Quality of life, depression, financial stress, and provider empathy scores were similar between individuals turned down for donation (n = 43) and donors (n = 128). Participants selected a discrete choice response to a statement about the overall quality of their lives; 32% of turned-down donors versus 7% of donors (P < 0.01)  assessed that their lives were worse after the center's decision about whether they could donate a kidney. Among turned-down donors who reported that life had worsened, 77% had an intended recipient who was never transplanted, versus 36% among individuals who assessed life as the same or better (P = 0.02). In interviews, the majority of turned-down donors reported emotional impact, including empathy, stress, and other challenges, related to having someone in their lives with end-stage kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS: Generic instruments measuring quality of life, depression, financial stress, and provider empathy revealed no significant differences between kidney donors and turned-down donors. However, qualitative interviews revealed preliminary evidence that some turned-down donors experienced emotional consequences.

Its aim is to provide leadership, guidance and recommendations that inform and support sound policy, and sector wide strategic planning and implementation at local, national, regional, and international levels.Inspired by the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism, this Agreement affirms the importance of the missions of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development); Universal Declaration of Human Rights; World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki-Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, and their Statement on  Organ and Tissue Donation; The Council for International Organizations of Medical Science's International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving  Humans 2016; and accords with the World Health Organization's 2010 Guiding principles on human cell, tissue, and organ transplantation-WHA63.22.With millions waiting for a corneal transplant at any given moment-and the majority residing in lower resource locations, a significant component of this Agreement promotes equitable allocation systems for waiting recipients, and the development of self-sufficient services. It recognises important instruments, such as the International Council of Ophthalmology 2017 Position Statement: Donation, Processing, Allocation, Advocacy, and Legislation Supporting Human Corneal Tissue for Ocular Transplant; the World Health Organization's Universal Eye Health-Global Action Plan 2014 to 2019, and the mission of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.Future biological innovations/technologies are also addressed within the Agreement, promoting research and development that  seek to improve donation utility, reduce burden, and improve therapeutic options  for recipients, without ethical compromise.The Agreement has been developed by the Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations in conjunction with the International Council of Ophthalmology, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, The Corneal Society, Asian Eye Bank Association, European Eye Bank  Association, Eye Bank Association of America, Eye Bank Association of Australia and New Zealand, Eye Bank Association of India, the Pan American Association of Eye Banks, and in countries and regions without eye bank organizations, their ophthalmic societies-such as the Ophthalmological Society of the West Indies, and the Pacific Eye Care Society.Finally, we endorse the current international consensus that prohibits trafficking and transplant tourism.";;;;eng;['Bioethics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Eye/*transplantation', '*Eye Banks', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*organization & administration'];;;;10.1097/ICO.0000000000001675

A number of patients who undergo euthanasia explicitly express their wish to donate their organs in a ""living organ donation"" procedure, which then causes death. Assuming that euthanasia is permitted, as expressed in Dutch and Belgian legislation, this exploratory article addresses whether it is legally and ethically sound to donate organs, especially the heart, as a living donor and to perform euthanasia in the same procedure in a patient who fulfills the due diligence requirements for euthanasia.

However, a chronic organ shortage overshadows this success. We define the organ shortage as a public health problem due to its serious consequences on patients and society. This definition raises the question of the state's role in  transplantation medicine. It leads us to formulate a public policy promoting organ donation through state incentives, ie regulatory instruments to reward individuals' willingness to donate. Incentives allow the state to express gratitude for the solidary act of the donor toward the recipient and society. In  an original approach, we integrate sociological findings as to the act of donation-the concept of reciprocity most importantly-into the core attributes of  such a public policy. Addressing regulatory design questions, we present incentives such as allocation priority, tax benefits, health insurance discounts, and coverage of funeral costs. We also examine the unique non-financial incentive successfully implemented in Israel. We then discuss the legal and ethical framework in which state incentives have to operate, concluding that normative constraints can be addressed through law reform. Finally, we focus on aspects neglected so far in public information campaigns and discuss the interaction between state policy and public opinion.;;Levy M;;eng;;['Organ shortage', 'Public health', 'Reciprocity and Solidarity', 'Regulatory design', 'State incentives', 'Stewardship role of the state'];;;10.1093/jlb/lsy009
1508;30190087;Article;2018;Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands);;An ethical appraisal of living-anonymous kidney donation using Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments.;;Ethical debates continue to shape organ transplant policies, particularly for kidneys. Facing organ shortages, governments have created incentives targeting prospective living-anonymous donors - socially and biologically unrelated to the  recipient. However, these policies may transform altruistic exchanges of tissues  into trades of commodities. We use Adam Smith's concept of sympathy to outline a  new approach to transplantation ethics. This is accomplished using a case study analysis of six countries with established living-anonymous kidney donation practices - Iran, Israel, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and  the United States. An ethical test was also developed from ethnographies of donors and Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments. The case study analysis considered the role of religious and historic norms, media campaigns, adherence to the 2008  Declaration of Istanbul guidelines for each case, and how each factor related to  Smith's sympathy, categorizing the countries into four tiers of altruism. Iran occupied the least altruistic tier, followed by the Netherlands, the UK and the US, and Saudi Arabia and Israel. The ethical test identified a similar ranking. Our findings suggest that a highly-selected cohort of states with established living-anonymous kidney donation programs may already utilize a Smithian approach for recruiting donors, and that socially-valued government incentives can preserve altruism.

1511;30168858;Article;2018;Bioethics;;Financing uterus transplants: The United States context.;;The first baby has successfully been born by uterus transplantation (UTx) in the  United States and the procedure is swiftly becoming a viable clinical option for  patients with uterine factor infertility (UFI). This raises a practical ethical question: should health insurers finance UTx and what issues should they consider in coming to this decision? The article lays forth some of the factors that shape the decision over whether to finance UTx in the United States, including what procedures must be covered, whether UTx is more like organ transplantation or infertility treatment (which are treated differently in the United States), and the benefits and alternatives of the procedure. Then, the article explores arguments around why UTx should be financed, or at least considered along with other important medical needs. The paper argues that UTx ought to be considered along with other competing claims for healthcare services. In countries that generously cover other infertility services, it may logically follow that medical services that enable gestation should be insured when the healthcare system covers services to conceive. In the United States, however, many groups have long suffered inadequate access to medical care, in the context of infertility and more broadly. U.S. healthcare may need to be made more widely equitable, before covering UTx is seen as financially or politically possible.;;Blake VK;;eng;['*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Female', '*Health Equity', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*therapy', '*Insurance, Health', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics/ethics', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*economics/ethics', 'United States', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['*ethics', '*healthcare finance', '*uterus transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12506

1514;30145113;Article;2018;European urology focus;;Complete Chain of the First Global Kidney Exchange Transplant and 3-yr Follow-up.;;BACKGROUND: Global Kidney Exchange (GKE) offers an opportunity to expand living renal transplantation internationally to patients without financial means. These  international pairs are entered into a US kidney exchange program that provides long-term financial support in an effort to identify opportunities for suitable exchanges for both these international pairs and US citizens. OBJECTIVE: While the promise of GKE is significant, it has been met with ethical criticism since its inception in 2015. This paper aims to demonstrate the selection process and provide >3 yr of follow-up on the first GKE donor and recipient from the Philippines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The first GKE transplant occurred with a young Filipino husband and wife who were immunologically compatible, but lacked the financial means to continue hemodialysis or undergo a kidney transplant in their home country. The pair was enrolled in the Alliance for Paired Donation matching system, several alternative kidney exchanges were identified, and the pair subsequently underwent renal transplantation and donation in the USA financed by philanthropy. The resulting nonsimultaneous extended altruistic chain provided transplantation for the Filipino husband and 11 US patients. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The Filipino donor and recipient were followed by transplant professionals in both the Philippines and the USA. Follow-up data were maintained as required by the Organ Procurement  and Transplantation Network in the USA. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The Filipino donor has normal blood pressure and renal function, and the Filipino recipient is doing well 3.5 yr after their donation and transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: While criticisms of GKE highlight concerns for possible exploitation of financially disadvantaged groups, these results demonstrate that these concerns did not come  to fruition, and the outcome experienced by the GKE donor and recipient (and other US participants) was successful. PATIENT SUMMARY: The first Filipino Global Kidney Exchange (GKE) donor-recipient pair continues to be followed by both US and Filipino transplant centers. Both are in good health, support the GKE program, and advocate for its expansion.;;Bozek DN, Dunn TB, Kuhr CS, Marsh CL, Rogers J, Rees SE, Basagoitia L, Brunner RJ, Roth AE, Ekwenna O, Fumo DE, Krawiec KD, Kopke JE, Sindhwani P, Ortiz J, Tan M, Paloyo SR, Punch JD, Rees MA;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Altruism', 'Directed Tissue Donation/*trends', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Histocompatibility/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*economics/ethics/methods', 'Living Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Philippines/epidemiology', 'Poverty/*ethnology', 'Renal Dialysis/economics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration/standards', 'Transplant Recipients/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology'];['*Finances', '*Kidney paired donation', '*National allocation policy', '*Nondirected living kidney donation', '*Poverty', '*Racial disparities', '*Renal transplant'];;R18 HS020610/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;10.1016/j.euf.2018.07.021
1515;30142168;Article;2018;PloS one;;What do people agree to when stating willingness to donate? On the medical interventions enabling organ donation after death.;;PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study is to explore donor relatives' experiences of the medical interventions enabling organ donation, as well as to examine the donor relatives' attitudes towards donating their own organs, and whether or not their experiences have influenced their own inclination to donate. METHODS: The experiences of donor relatives were explored via in-depth interviews. The interviews covered every step from the deceased family member being struck by a severe bleeding in the brain till after the organ recovery, including the medical interventions enabling organ donation. The interviews were  analysed through qualitative and quantitative content analysis. RESULTS: Brain death and organ donation proved to be hard to understand for many donor relatives. The prolonged interventions provided after death in order to enable organ donation misled some relatives to believe that their family member still was alive. In general, the understanding for what treatment aimed at saving the family member and what interventions aimed at maintaining organ viability was low. However, most donor relatives were either inspired to, or reinforced in their willingness to, donate their own organs after having experienced the loss of a family member who donated organs. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for greater transparency regarding the whole chain of events during the donation process. Yet, having experienced the donation process closely did not discourage the donor relatives from donating their own organs-but rather inspired a willingness to donate. This indicates an acceptance of the medical procedures necessary in order to enable organ donation after death.;;Gyllstrom Krekula L, Forinder U, Tibell A;;eng;['Adult', '*Attitude', 'Death', 'Decision Making', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*trends'];;The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.;;10.1371/journal.pone.0202544

A widely accepted online risk calculator (OLRC) is no  exception. It uses 6.4 year observations and an ostensibly empiric methodology to predict low lifetime risks for normal young candidates. But the nonspecific ESRD  risk factors identified in this study are likely features of kidney diseases that were already underway at study entry. No practicing nephrologist would use their  absence to predict any specific kidney disease that had yet to begin, which is essential for excluding high-risk individuals. The OLRC's risk estimates are particularly low because it also does not assign to young adults about 70% of the lifetime ESRD that they will experience as they age, which is part of their risk. It reinforces traditional concepts of low donor risk, minimizing the potential relevance of recent, sometimes concerning, long-term outcome data. These data suggest many similarities between postdonation ESRD and ESRD in the general population, about which much is already known. Despite our best efforts, the heterogeneity and exponential accumulation of end-stage kidney diseases over time prevent long-term predictions of risk for young kidney donors.;;Steiner RW;;eng;['Adult', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrectomy/*adverse effects', 'Nephrology/methods', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult'];['*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics and public policy', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*kidney transplantation: living donor', '*risk assessment/risk stratification'];;;10.1111/ajt.15089
1517;30134745;Article;2019;Nursing ethics;;Perspectives toward brain death diagnosis and management of the potential organ donor.;;"BACKGROUND: Organ donation and transplantation represent one of the most important scientific advances over the last decades. Due to the complexity of these procedures and related ethical-legal aspects, however, there are a lot of doubts and uncertainty about the brain death diagnosis and the maintenance of potential organ donor. AIM: To identify and discuss the different meanings and experiences of registered nurses and physicians from an adult intensive care unit in relation to the diagnosis of brain death and the maintenance of potential organ donors for transplantation purposes. STUDY DESIGN: Participants were registered nurses and physicians from an adult intensive care unit at a University Hospital from Brazil. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: This study was approved by the University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto College of Nursing Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: Two main categories emerged from the  analysis: (1) brain death diagnosis and its implications and (2) maintenance of the potential organ donor and its repercussion in the donation-transplantation process. Six subcategories were also identified: (1.1) understanding the brain death diagnosis as a tool to aid decision-making; (1.2) diagnosis as guarantee of rights; (1.3) difficulties encountered to establish the diagnosis; (1.4) clinical criteria adopted in Brazil and related ethical-legal aspects; (2.1) specificities of care to the brain dead person and outcomes; and (2.2) nurse's duties toward the brain dead person. CONCLUSION: Although the brain death diagnosis is scientifically and legally defined in Brazil and the maintenance of the potential organ donor for transplantation purposes has been addressed during the last years, there are still some doubts about the subject, as its understanding varies according to the personal beliefs, culture, and educational background of individuals, including those who work in this scenario.";;Victorino JP, Mendes KDS, Westin UM, Magro JTJ, Corsi CAC, Ventura CAA;;eng;['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', '*Brain Death', 'Brazil', 'Decision Making/ethics', '*Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Qualitative Research', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/methods'];['Brain death', 'intensive care', 'nurses', 'organ donation', 'physicians'];;;10.1177/0969733018791335

The possible legal requirements of distribution must be balanced with (a) the moral and statutory imperatives to reduce inequities resulting from socioeconomic disparity, and (b)  the shortcomings of MELD in predicting mortality risk in rural areas. In this viewpoint, we use the example of liver transplantation to discuss the drivers of  geographic disparity as a direct consequence of donation rates, local organ use,  wealth, and poverty. Seen in this light, strategies seeking to equalize MELD at transplant across the United States risk severely exacerbating existing inequalities in access to health care.;;Lynch RJ, Magliocca JF, Hundley JC, Karp SJ;;eng;['Geography', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/*organization & administration', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Regional Health Planning', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration', 'United States', '*Waiting Lists'];['*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*organ transplantation in general'];;;10.1111/ajt.15079

OBJECTIVE:  To analyze common characteristics amongst altruistic donors in order to promote non-directed and voucher-based donation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Information regarding altruistic donations from 2008 to 2015 and voucher-based donors was obtained from the National Kidney Registry. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: An SES index, created and validated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), was created by geocoding the donor's zip  code and linking it to seven publicly available SES variables found in the 2010 United States Census data. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 267 non-directed and 3 voucher-based donations were identified. Non-directed donors were predominantly female (58%), with an average age of 45.6 yr (range, 21-72). The mean SES index score was 55.6 (SD=3.2), which corresponds to the 77th percentile  of 1.5 million MediCare beneficiaries as reported by the AHRQ in 2008. Voucher-based donors were Caucasian males of high SES. The study was limited by the number of voucher-based donations. CONCLUSIONS: Non-directed and voucher-based donors are in the upper end of the economic spectrum. The voucher-based program has built within it the inherent capacity to remove disincentives to donation, which currently limit altruistic donation. PATIENT SUMMARY: We wanted to determine what types of people donated their kidneys altruistically, so that we could understand how to motivate more people to donate their kidneys.

1521;30121868;Article;2019;Pediatric cardiology;;Variations in Criteria and Practices for Heart Transplantation Listing Among Pediatric Transplant Cardiologists.;;Ethical issues in pediatric heart transplantation (Htx) include resource allocation, benefit, and burden assessment in high-risk recipients, and informed  consent. Practice patterns and decision-making was investigated using an internet survey with 47-multiple choice items and vignette-based questions. Of 43 pediatric Htx cardiologists contacted, 28 (65%) responded. Respondents reported that an overall median 1-month survival of 73% (range 50-100%), 1-year survival of 70% (range 50-85%), 5-year survival of 50% (range 40-85%), and 10-year survival of 50% (range 25-85%) was adequate to offer Htx. Based on vignettes presented, 100% of those surveyed would offer Htx to a straightforward 12-year old with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy and a 7-year old with hypoplastic left  heart syndrome with protein losing enteropathy. Thirty percent of physicians would offer Htx to a patient status post a Fontan procedure with mutliple co-morbidities. Seventy-five percent of physicians would offer Htx despite proven non-adherence. Considerable variability exists in the practice patterns of pediatric heart transplant cardiologists with regards to decision-making while evaluating patients for listing. Disagreements among pediatric Htx cardiologists  exist when there are concerns for non-adherence and associated multiple co-morbidities. Further work is needed to understand these variations and develop consensus for pediatric Htx organ allocation.;;Patel A, Michelson K, Andrei AC, Pahl E, Gossett JG;;eng;"['Adult', 'Cardiologists/*ethics/standards', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clinical Decision-Making', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Heart Transplantation/*ethics/mortality/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Pilot Projects', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']";['Ethics', 'Heart transplantation', 'Pediatric'];;;10.1007/s00246-018-1965-x
1522;30119629;Article;2018;BMC medical ethics;;Reuse of cardiac organs in transplantation: an ethical analysis.;;"BACKGROUND: This paper examines the ethical aspects of organ transplant surgery in which a donor heart is transplanted from a first recipient, following determination of death by neurologic criteria, to a second recipient. Retransplantation in this sense differs from that in which one recipient undergoes repeat heart transplantation of a newly donated organ, and is thus referred to here as ""reuse cardiac organ transplantation."" METHODS: Medical, legal, and ethical analysis, with a main focus on ethical analysis. RESULTS: From the medical perspective, it is critical to ensure the quality and safety of reused organs, but we lack sufficient empirical data pertaining to medical risk.  From the legal perspective, a comparative examination of laws in the United States and Japan affirms no illegality, but legal scholars disagree on the appropriate analysis of the issues, including whether or not property rights apply to transplanted organs. Ethical arguments supporting the reuse of organs include the analogous nature of donation to gifts, the value of donations as inheritance property, and the public property theory as it pertains to organs. Meanwhile, ethical arguments such as those that address organ recycling and identity issues challenge organ reuse. CONCLUSION: We conclude that organ reuse is not only ethically permissible, but even ethically desirable. Furthermore, we  suggest changes to be implemented in the informed consent process prior to organ  transplantation. The organ transplant community worldwide should engage in wider  and deeper discussions, in hopes that such efforts will lead to the timely preparation of guidelines to implement reuse cardiac organ transplantation as well as reuse transplantation of other organs such as kidney and liver.";;Nakazawa E, Maeda S, Yamamoto K, Akabayashi A, Uetake Y, Shaw MH, Demme RA, Akabayashi A;;eng;['Adult', 'Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Ownership/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patient Safety', 'Reoperation/*ethics', 'Tissue Donors/ethics', 'United States'];['*Ethical aspect', '*Heart transplantation', '*Japan', '*Legal aspect', '*Property right', '*Retransplantation', '*Reuse organ transplantation', '*United States'];;;10.1186/s12910-018-0316-z

Although hospital DCDD protocols  stipulate donor death determination, some do not adhere to national guidelines that require mechanical, not electrical, asystole. Surrogate decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapy should be separated from decisions to donate organs. Donor families should be given sufficient information about the DCDD protocol and its impact on the dying process to provide informed consent, and donors should be given proper palliative care during dying.

Reported outcomes suggest that this life-enhancing transplantation is viable and ethically justified for appropriate patients. Given that pediatric hand transplantation has been performed with promising reported outcomes, it is time to consider how to properly expand the field of face transplantation into pediatric patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Appropriate collaboration between adult and pediatric colleagues can mitigate risks associated with expanding surgical innovation between respective patient demographics. The reported outcomes of the first pediatric hand transplant question the appropriateness of increasing immunosuppression burden to a patient on an existing regimen for prior solid organ allotransplantion. Young donor allografts prove to be more resilient, however, implying that managing rejection episodes is key to long-term viability. Expanding face transplants into a younger population must consider the social functions of the face, and may facilitate healthy personal development given the cultural value appearance has in real life and in social media.

It was introduced in an attempt to increase the number of life-saving transplants taking place in the UK, in a move that policy makers hoped would mirror Spain's success. More recently, pressure has been mounting for England to  follow suit, with a public consultation currently in progress. However, the Welsh system has been far from a success, raising the question of why campaigners are so adamant that it should be replicated. Before the Welsh Government introduced the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act there had been no strong evidence to suggest it would make a difference, with countries boasting both high organ donation rates and presumed consent legislation demonstrating no clear causal relationship between the two facts. In addition, a recent report evaluating the Act has highlighted its failure to improve donation rates, and has even presented some potentially concerning statistics that may suggest a negative impact.

Several sociodemographic features had a positive association with believing organ donation to be permitted: ethnic descent other than that of South Asian, having immigrated to the USA as an adult, and male sex. When using a logistic regression model controlling for these three variables as potential confounders, the best predictor of Muslim physicians believing organ donation to be permissible was utilization of an Imam as a bioethical resource (odds ratio 5.9, p = 0.02). Religiosity variables were not found to be associated with views on the Islamic permissibility of organ donation. While Muslim American physicians appear to believe there is religious support for organ donation, only  a minority sign up to be donors. Greater study is needed to understand how physicians' attitudes regarding donation impact discussions between patients and  physicians regarding the possibility of donating and of receiving a transplant.";;Ahmed M, Kubilis P, Padela A;;eng;['Adult', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', '*Islam', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Physicians/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['Islamic bioethics', 'Islamic law', 'Organ transplantation', 'Religiosity'];;;10.1007/s10943-018-0683-2

To determine whether this is a cost-effective approach, a decision tree model was developed to analyze costs and effectiveness over a 5-year time frame between 2 choices: RT using a D+/R- strategy compared to continuing dialysis and waiting for a HCV-negative donor (D-/R-). The strategy of accepting a HCV+ organ then treating HCV was slightly more effective and substantially less expensive and resulted in an expected 4.8 years of life (YOL) with a cost of approximately $138 000 compared to an expected 4.7 YOL with a cost of approximately $329 000 for the D-/R- strategy. The D+/R- strategy remained dominant after sensitivity analyses including the difference in RT death probabilities or acute rejection probabilities between using D+ vs D- kidney; time that D-/R- patients waited for  RT; dialysis death probabilities while waitlisted for RT in the D-/R- strategy; DAA therapy expected cure rate; costs of transplant, immunosuppressives, DAA therapy, dialysis, or acute rejection.

Retrospective review of ALF liver transplant  (LTx) patients between 1997 and 2017 (n = 47) was conducted. Psychosocial history, life stressors, and ability to participate in transplant were recorded.  Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression. Eleven patients (31.5%) had poor adherence, four died, all from graft failure. Of 13 with fair and 12 with good adherence, two died, no adherence related. Poor adherence was associated with higher mortality (P = 0.04), but by Kaplan-Meier, their five- and 10-year survival was 78 and 54 per cent, versus fair and good adherence (five years, 83% P = 0.3). Participating in transplant decision improved survival (five years, 80%) versus not participating (five years, 61%; P  = 0.03). Of 10 early deaths, three were neurologic and five of sepsis. Overall, one- and five-year survival was 78 and 69 per cent. ALF represents the nemesis of LTx programs. Psychosocial aspects pre-LTx, stressors, and poor adherence affected survival in this series.

1535;30062839;Article;2018;Journal of evaluation in clinical practice;;Understanding the sex disparity in living kidney donation.;;"Living donors are the preferred source of organs for kidney transplantation, which is the treatment modality of choice for end-stage kidney disease. Health care systems widely promote living kidney donation. However, women are consistently overrepresented among living donors. The reasons behind the sex-based disparity in living kidney donation remain poorly understood. Compared  to women, men possess a greater amount of kidney function, and the higher deceased donation rate among men reflects their higher overall kidney quality. A  plausible medical explanation for the sex-based disparity in living kidney donation includes an uncompromising emphasis on preserving donor health, with less emphasis placed on organ quality, which is the main criterion in deceased donor selection. On the other hand, consent to deceased donation is also greater  in women, indicating their greater desire to donate even though fewer women actually become deceased donors. Therefore, nonmedical reasons for the sex disparity in living donation must be sought. Increased empathic distress or emotional memory; a greater sense of responsibility, urgency, and impulsiveness with increased reaction to empathy; a different body image; and a different social status may all contribute to greater living kidney donation in women. Economic inequity may be the singular explanation when personal worth links to economic worth. To better understand the sex disparity in living kidney donation, we need better data on the reasons behind both nondonation and donor rejection after evaluation in clinical practice. Nondirected living kidney donation provides unique opportunities to minimize factors such as emotional distress, empathy, and impulsiveness. More liberal acceptance criteria for donors with isolated medical abnormalities and testing legitimate donor reimbursement strategies based on actual income levels rather than a fixed amount can assist in both ascertaining the reasons behind the sex disparity in living kidney donation  and increasing overall living kidney donation rates.";;Prasad GVR;;eng;"['*Donor Selection/economics/ethics', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Health Policy', 'Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/psychology', '*Living Donors/ethics/psychology', 'Philosophy, Medical', '*Sex Factors', ""Women's Health""]";['*evaluation', '*health policy', '*philosophy of medicine'];;;10.1111/jep.13015

1537;30048000;Article;2018;Bioethics;;Positioning uterus transplantation as a 'more ethical' alternative to surrogacy:  Exploring symmetries between uterus transplantation and surrogacy through analysis of a Swedish government white paper.;;Within the ethics and science literature surrounding uterus transplantation (UTx), emphasis is often placed on the extent to which UTx might improve upon, or offer additional benefits when compared to, existing 'treatment options' for women with absolute uterine factor infertility, such as adoption and gestational  surrogacy. Within this literature UTx is often positioned as superior to surrogacy because it can deliver things that surrogacy cannot (such as the experience of gestation). Yet, in addition to claims that UTx is superior in the  aforementioned sense it is also often assumed (either implicitly or explicitly) that UTx is less fraught with ethical difficulties and thus should be considered  a less morally problematic option. This article seeks to examine this assumption. Given that much UTx research has been performed in Sweden, a country where surrogacy is effectively although not currently explicitly forbidden, we do this  through an analysis of the arguments underpinning a 2016 Swedish white paper which considered amending existing policy such that altruistic surrogacy arrangements would be permitted. By applying the white paper's arguments for a restrictive position on altruistic surrogacy to the case of UTx using living altruistic donors we find that such arguments, if they hold in the case of surrogacy, apply similarly to UTx. We thus suggest that, for reasons of consistency, a similar stance should be taken towards the moral and legal permissibility of these two practices.;;Guntram L, Williams NJ;;eng;['Altruism', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Female', 'Government', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*therapy', 'Living Donors', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Policy', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*ethics', '*Surrogate Mothers/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Sweden', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['*consistency', '*legislation and policy', '*reproductive ethics', '*surrogacy', '*transplantation ethics', '*uterus transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12469

The purpose of the investigation was to assess the extent of the outbreak including environmental contamination and to limit further transmission. Methods: We used retrospective patient and laboratory data including pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing and virulence and resistance gene analysis. For comparison of medians the Mann-Whitney and for comparison of proportions the Fisher exact tests were used. Results: PFGE typing  of VRE strains of an outbreak of 15 VRE cases in a solid transplant unit revealed that nine of the cases belonged to one identical pattern (A), which was only found twice in the environment. Eleven further positive environmental samples showed a different, but identical PFGE pattern E. Only one patient was infected with this environmental strain.Two of nine (22.2%) PFGE A, but nine of eleven (81.2%) PFGE E samples were positive for gelatinase E (p = 0.01), which is described as enhancing biofilm production, suggesting a survival benefit for this strain on inanimate surfaces. Conclusion: Routine disinfection was not able to stop the cluster, but after repeated enforcement of the infection prevention and  control (IPC) bundle such as training, strict adherence to hand hygiene and surface disinfection no further cases were observed. We conclude that certain VRE strains predominate in the environment whereas others predominate in humans.

METHODS: A qualitative analysis was designed. A purposive expert sampling was then performed in organ transplant as it was chosen as the ideal model of surgical innovation. Interviews were designed, and main themes included the following: definition of surgical innovation, the decision-making process of surgical innovation, and ethical dilemmas. A semistructured design was designed to analyze the decision-making process, using the Forces Interaction Model. An in-depth design with open-ended questions was chosen to define surgical innovation and ethical dilemmas. RESULTS: Interviews were performed in 2014. Participants were 7 professors of surgery: 3 in liver transplant, 2 in heart transplant, and 2 in face transplant. Saturation  was reached. They demonstrated an intuitive understanding of surgical innovation. Using the Forces Interaction Model, decision leading to contemporary innovation results mainly from collegiality, when the surgeon was previously the main factor. The patient is seemingly lesser in the decision. A perfect innovative surgeon was described (with resiliency, legitimacy, and no technical restriction). Ethical conflicts were related to risk assessment and doubts regarding methodology when most participants (4/7) described ethical dilemma as being irrelevant. CONCLUSIONS: Innovation in surgery is teamwork. Therefore, it should be performed in specific specialized centers. Those centers should include Ethics and Laws department in order to integrate these concepts to innovative process.

Rather, it is to propose ways in which ethical analysis and provision of UTx can potentially accommodate the concerns discussed here. I argue that the adoption alternative to UTx is too readily dismissed, and that this is a dismissal with significant moral costs. I suggest that the radical nature of UTx as a form of assisted reproduction calls for an equivalently radical socio-moral agenda for reform and  transformation of adoption law, policy and practice, as well as of the norms that prevail within our presently strongly bio-normative reproductive context. In doing so I widen the ethical frame of responsible provision of assisted reproduction to encompass not just obligations towards donors and recipient, but  also our broader social responsibilities to ensure that we are doing our best to  meet the significant needs of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.;;Lotz M;;eng;['*Adoption', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*therapy', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', '*Reproduction', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*ethics', '*Social Responsibility', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['*adoption', '*assisted reproduction', '*ethics', '*reproduction', '*uterus transplantation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12490
1546;30018475;Article;2018;World journal of gastroenterology;;Liver transplantation and alcoholic liver disease: History, controversies, and considerations.;;"Alcohol consumption accounts for 3.8% of annual global mortality worldwide, and the majority of these deaths are due to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), mainly alcoholic cirrhosis. ALD is one of the most common indications for liver transplantation (LT). However, it remains a complicated topic on both medical and ethical grounds, as it is seen by many as a ""self-inflicted disease"". One of the  strongest ethical arguments against LT for ALD is the probability of relapse. However, ALD remains a common indication for LT worldwide. For a patient to be placed on an LT waiting list, 6 mo of abstinence must have been achieved for most LT centers. However, this ""6-mo rule"" is an arbitrary threshold and has never been shown to affect survival, sobriety, or other outcomes. Recent studies have shown similar survival rates among individuals who undergo LT for ALD and those who undergo LT for other chronic causes of end-stage liver disease. There are specific factors that should be addressed when evaluating LT patients with ALD because these patients commonly have a high prevalence of multisystem alcohol-related changes. Risk factors for relapse include the presence of anxiety or depressive disorders, short pre-LT duration of sobriety, and lack of social support. Identification of risk factors and strengthening of the social support system may decrease relapse among these patients. Family counseling for LT candidates is highly encouraged to prevent alcohol consumption relapse. Relapse has been associated with unique histopathological changes, graft damage, graft loss, and even decreased survival in some studies. Research has demonstrated the  importance of a multidisciplinary evaluation of LT candidates. Complete abstinence should be attempted to overcome addiction issues and to allow spontaneous liver recovery. Abstinence is the cornerstone of ALD therapy. Psychotherapies, including 12-step facilitation therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and motivational enhancement therapy, help support abstinence. Nutritional therapy helps to reverse muscle wasting, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, and trace element deficiencies associated with ALD. For muscular recovery, supervised physical activity has been shown to lead to a gain in muscle mass and improvement of functional activity. Early LT for acute alcoholic hepatitis has been the subject of recent clinical studies, with encouraging results in highly selected patients. The survival rates after LT for ALD are comparable to those of patients who underwent LT for other indications. Patients  that undergo LT for ALD and survive over 5 years have a higher risk of cardiorespiratory disease, cerebrovascular events, and de novo malignancy.";;Marroni CA, Fleck AM Jr, Fernandes SA, Galant LH, Mucenic M, de Mattos Meine MH, Mariante-Neto G, Brandao ABM;;eng;['Alcohol Abstinence', 'Alcoholism/*complications/therapy', 'End Stage Liver Disease/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases, Alcoholic/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*standards', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', 'Psychotherapy/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Support', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Waiting Lists'];['Alcoholic abstinence', 'Alcoholic cirrhosis', 'Alcoholic hepatitis', 'Alcoholic liver disease', 'Alcoholic recurrence', 'Alcoholism', 'Controversies', 'Liver transplantation', 'Relapse', 'Selection criteria'];Conflict-of-interest statement: No potential conflicts of interest.

In our study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of the OB against TAC-induced mitochondrial nephrotoxicity in CD1 mice.  Mice were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 (control group); administered orally with normal saline (1mL/kg) for two weeks; Group 2 (OB extract treated-group) (500mg/kg b.wt) gavaged once/day for two weeks; Group 3 (TAC-treated group) (3mg/kg b.wt, administered ip once a day for two weeks); and  Group 4; (TAC plus OB extract treated-group). Tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity was assessed biochemically and histopathologically. The OB extract was high in phenolic content (50.3mg/g of gallic acid equivalent), total flavonoids (14.5mg/g CE equivalent). The potential antioxidant efficacy of the extract (IC50) was 24.5mug/mL. OB pretreatment significantly improved the TAC-induced changes in biochemical markers of nephrotoxicity for instance blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, total protein, and albumin (P<0.01, when compared with TAC treated group). Also, it significantly restored the increase activities of TBARS, protein carbonyl (PC) (P<0.001, when compared to healthy control group) and decreased activities of nonprotein thiol (NP-SH) levels, Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) antioxidants of mitochondria. The nephroprotective efficacy of the OB leaves extract was further evident by histopathological analysis together with the PCNA-ir and Bcl2.

Herein, we report the results of our investigation into the feasibility of a multicentre prospective cohort study addressing the afformentioned issues. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month prospective observational cohort study in six ICUs and one coronary care unit in Hamilton, Canada. We included consecutive children and adults following consent for deceased organ donation (including neurologic determination of death [NDD] or donation after circulatory death [DCD]). Intensive care unit research staff recorded donor management data from hospital records, extending from one day prior to the consent for organ donation up to the time of organ retrieval. The provincial Organ Donation Organization (ODO) supplemented these data and, additionally, provided data on corresponding organ recipients. We identified, evaluated, and measured three potential obstacles to the feasibility of a national cohort study: obtaining authorization to implement the study with a waiver of research consent, accessibility of transplant recipient data, and the time required to complete very detailed case report forms (CRFs), with valuable lessons learned for implementation in future projects. RESULTS: The local Research Ethics Board and the ODO Privacy Office both authorized the recording of donor and recipient study data with a waiver of research consent. Sixty-seven consecutive consented donors  were included (31 NDD and 36 DCD donors); 50 of them provided 144 organs for transplantation to 141 recipients. We identified the age and sex of the recipients as well as the location and date of transplant for all organ recipients in Ontario; however, we obtained no recipient data for six organs transported outside of Ontario. Intensive care unit research staff estimated that future CRF completion will require five to seven hours per patient. CONCLUSION: The Hamilton-DONATE pilot study supports the feasibility of a larger cohort study to describe the epidemiology and clinical practices related to deceased donor care in Canada.

The expectation is that transplantation of NCNRs will not compromise access for US citizens/residents (USCRs), and that NCNRs would have similar post-LT follow-up. This has never been formally assessed. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data from February 27, 2002 to December 31, 2016 were used to identify NCNRs and compare to USCRs, excluding Status 1 adults. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze  waitlist outcomes, and competing risk analysis was used to assess rates of lost to follow-up post-LT. From February 27, 2002 to December 31, 2016, 1260 NCNRs were listed for LT (0.86% of listings). Adjusted probability of DDLT was not significantly different for NCNRs and USCRs (P > .5), but NCNRs were significantly less likely to be removed from the waitlist for death or clinical deterioration (aOR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.69-0.93, P = .003). In multivariable competing risk models, NCNRs had an 11-fold higher risk of being lost to follow-up after accounting for the competing risk of death (SHR: 11.44, 95% CI: 8.72-15.01, P < .001), as well as lower rates of posttransplant mortality (SHR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.91, P = .012). Our findings speak to the need to standardize practices for NCNRs and set expectations for post-LT care.;;Ferrante ND, Goldberg DS;;eng;['Adult', 'Emigration and Immigration/*statistics & numerical data', 'End Stage Liver Disease/*mortality/surgery', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*mortality', '*Lost to Follow-Up', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Waiting Lists/*mortality'];['*United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)', '*clinical research/practice', '*ethics and public policy', '*liver transplantation/hepatology', '*organ allocation', '*patient survival', '*recipient selection'];;;10.1111/ajt.15005

We examined use and outcomes of implantable  ventricular assist devices (VADs) in a national ESRD cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD who underwent implantable VAD placement from 2006 to 2014. We examined in-hospital and 1-year mortality, all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations, and heart/kidney transplantation outcomes. We investigated as predictors demographic  factors, time-period of VAD implantation, primary or post-cardiotomy implantation, and duration of ESRD before VAD implantation. We identified 96 people with ESRD who underwent implantable VAD placement. At time of VAD implantation, 74 (77.1%) were receiving hemodialysis, 10 (10.4%) were receiving peritoneal dialysis and 12 (12.5%) had renal transplant. Time from incident ESRD  to VAD implantation was median 4.0 (interquartile range 1.1, 8.2) years. Mortality during the implantation hospitalization was 40.6%. Within 1 year of implantation 61.5% of people had died. On multivariable analysis, males had half  the mortality risk of females. Lower mortality risk was also seen with VAD implantation in a primary setting, and with more recent year of implantation, but these results did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD are undergoing durable VAD implantation, often several years after incident ESRD, although in low numbers. Mortality is high among these patients, highlighting the need for investigations to improve treatment selection and management.;;Walther CP, Niu J, Winkelmayer WC, Cheema FH, Nair AP, Morgan JA, Fedson SE, Deswal A, Navaneethan SD;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/complications/*therapy', 'Heart Transplantation', '*Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/*therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Prosthesis Implantation', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States'];['*end-stage renal disease', '*kidney', '*ventricular assist device'];;;10.1161/JAHA.118.008664

Is it ethical?;;Liver transplant centres throughout the USA face a huge shortage of liver organs  for their wait-listed patients. Various types of innovations are being considered for expansion of this donor pool. Organs that were previously deemed to be high risk are now being considered for transplantation. For the last 25 years, hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc+) organs have been used for liver transplantation. While the initial transplantations did reveal a high incidence of de novo hepatitis (DNH) in the recipients, the medical knowledge and experience have evolved and this risk has been markedly decreased. In this paper, medical literature evaluating the safety of such organ transplants has been reviewed. There is strong evidence to suggest that using anti-HBc+ organs with appropriate prophylaxis after transplant is a safe practice with good patient and graft survivals. In the second half of the paper, we discuss whether it is ethical to use anti-HBc+ organs. We argue that the use of such organs is in compliance with the principles of medical ethics and that society at large benefits from the use of these organs. Hence, we recommend that the use of such organs is both safe and ethical and this practice should be continued in the future.;;Anwar N, Sherman KE;;eng;['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis B/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies/immunology', 'Hepatitis B Core Antigens/immunology', 'Hepatitis B virus/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation/ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Prevalence', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome'];['*hepatitis B virus', '*liver disease', '*transplantation'];;;10.1111/jvh.12962

This commentary examines how the GPS methodology was applied to the development of a recent guideline for pediatric deceased donation after circulatory determined death. This guideline was informed by a broad body of indirect literature and addressed a variety of social, legal, and ethical questions in addition to several implementation issues. While the resulting document contained a vast majority of GPS (63 as opposed to seven actionable GRADEd recommendations), we maintain that this application was appropriate to develop recommendations within  the GRADE framework. This commentary explores how GPS may be applied in this context and explores whether a new classification of recommendations focused on these types of issues may be appropriate.;;Weiss MJ, Hornby L, Shemie SD, Appleby A, Rochwerg B;;eng;['Child', 'Death', 'Humans', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];['*Ethics', '*GRADE methodology', '*Good practice statements', '*Guideline development', '*Organ donation', '*Pediatrics'];;;10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.06.008
1556;29961024;Article;2018;BMJ open;;Evaluation of published assessment tools for comorbidity in liver transplantation: a systematic review protocol.;;INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is considered the best therapy option for end-stage liver disease. Different factors including recipient comorbidity at time of transplantation are supposed to have substantial impact on outcomes. Although several studies have focused on comorbidity assessment indices for liver transplant recipients, there is no systematic review available on the methodological details and prognostic accuracy of these instruments. The aim of this study is to systematically review recipient comorbidity assessment indices in the context of liver transplantation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and PsyINFO databases will be searched. Studies describing, using  or evaluating specific assessment tools to predict the effect of comorbidity on clinical outcomes after liver transplantation will be included. The selection will be conducted independently by two reviewers. The study characteristics and methodological information on published comorbidity assessment tools will be extracted into a predefined structural table. This approach will be deployed to systematically extract information on the validity, reliability and practical feasibility of investigated comorbidity assessment tools for comparative evaluation. Narrative information synthesis will be conducted, and additional meta-analytical comparison will be performed, if appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All data are collected from published literature. Thus, formal ethics review for the research is not required. The findings of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences. The results of this systematic review will be highly relevant for further research on prognostic models, clinical decision making and optimisation  of donor organ allocation.

1559;29954874;Article;2018;Journal of medical ethics;;How important is social support in determining patients' suitability for transplantation? Results from a National Survey of Transplant Clinicians.;;"BACKGROUND: National guidelines require programmes use subjective assessments of  social support when determining transplant suitability, despite limited evidence  linking it to outcomes. We examined how transplant providers weigh the importance of social support for kidney transplantation compared with other factors, and variation by clinical role and personal beliefs. METHODS: The National survey of  the American Society of Transplant Surgeons and the Society of Transplant Social  Work in 2016. Using a discrete choice approach, respondents compared two hypothetical patient profiles and selected one for transplantation. Conditional logistic regression estimated the relative importance of each factor; results were stratified by clinical role (psychosocial vs medical/surgical providers) and beliefs (outcomes vs equity). RESULTS: Five hundred and eighy-four transplant providers completed the survey. Social support was the second most influential factor among transplant providers. Providers were most likely to choose a candidate who had social support (OR=1.68, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.86), always adhered to a medical regimen (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.46 to 1.88), and had a 15 years life expectancy with transplant (OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.85). Psychosocial providers were more influenced by adherence and quality of life compared with medical/surgical providers, who were more influenced by candidates' life expectancy with transplant (p<0.05). For providers concerned with avoiding organ  waste, social support was the most influential factor, while it was the least influential for clinicians concerned with fairness (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Social  support is highly influential in listing decisions and may exacerbate transplant  disparities. Providers' beliefs and reliance on social support in determining suitability vary considerably, raising concerns about transparency and justice.";;Ladin K, Emerson J, Butt Z, Gordon EJ, Hanto DW, Perloff J, Daniels N, Lavelle TA;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Eligibility Determination/*ethics', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', '*Social Support', 'Young Adult'];['*allocation of organs/tissues', '*decision-making', '*social aspects', '*social work', '*surgery'];Competing interests: None declared.;KL2 TR001063/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States;10.1136/medethics-2017-104695

METHODS: Using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we identified 101 living multiorgan donors and their 133 recipients. RESULTS: The 49 sequential (donations during separate procedures) multiorgan donors provided grafts to 81 recipients: 21 kidney-then-liver, 15 liver-then-kidney, 5 lung-then-kidney, 3 liver-then-intestine, 3 kidney-then-pancreas, 1 lung-then-liver, and 1 pancreas-then-kidney. Of these donors, 38% donated 2 grafts to the same recipient and 15% donated 2 grafts as non-directed donors. Compared to recipients from first-time, single organ living  donors, recipients from second-time living donors had similar graft and patient survival. The 52 simultaneous (multiple donations during one procedure) multiorgan donors provided 2 grafts to 1 recipient each: 48 kidney-pancreas and 4 liver-intestine. Donors had median of 13.4 years (interquartile range, 8.3-18.5 years) of follow-up. There was one reported death of a sequential donor (2.5 years after second donation). Few postdonation complications were reported over a median of 116 days (interquartile range, 0-295 days) of follow-up; however, routine living donor follow-up data were sparse. Recipients of kidneys from second-time living donors had similar graft (P = 0.2) and patient survival (P = 0.4) when compared with recipients from first-time living donors. Similarly, recipients of livers from second-time living donors had similar graft survival (P = 0.9) and patient survival (P = 0.7) when compared with recipients from first-time living donors.

Bridge to decision involves using temporary devices to stabilize the hemodynamic state of such patients while further assessment is performed and a decision can be made regarding patient management. The purpose of this study (NCVC-BTD_01, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center-Bridge to Dicision_01) is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the newly developed extracorporeal continuous-flow ventricular assist system employing a disposable centrifugal pump with a hydrodynamically levitated bearing (BR16010) use as a bridge-to-decision therapy for patients with severe heart failure or refractory cardiogenic shock. METHOD/DESIGN: NCVC-BTD_01 is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, exploratory, medical device, investigator-initiated clinical study. It is conducted at the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center in Japan. A total of nine patients will be enrolled in the study. The study was planned using Simon's minimax two-stage phase design. The primary endpoint is a composite of survival free of device-related serious adverse events and complications during device support. For left ventricular assistance, withdrawal of a trial device due to cardiac function recovery or exchange to other ventricular assist devices (VADs) for the purpose of bridge to transplantation (BTT) during 30 days after implantation will be considered study successes. For right ventricular assistance, withdrawal of tal device due to right ventricular function recovery within 30 days after implantation will be considered a study success. Secondary objectives include changes in brain natriuretic peptide levels (7 days after implantation of a trial device and the day of withdrawal of a trial device), period of mechanical ventricular support, changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (7 days after implantation of a trial device and the day of withdrawal of a trial device), and changes in left ventricular diastolic dimension (7 days after implantation of a trial device and the day of withdrawal of a trial device).

We sought to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of  cases of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections (CRKP-BSIs) in kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs) from DCD in our hospital. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data of CRKP-BSIs in KTRs admitted  to a Chinese hospital in Beijing, China, between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 was performed. The annual percentage of patients with CRKP, the annual number of total KTRs and KTRs from DCD were determined. The genetic relatedness of the strains was determined by polymerase chain reaction and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: During the study period, there were total 947 KTRs in our hospital, including 275 KTRs from DCD. Five incidences of CRKP-BSIs in KTRs were identified, and two of them (Case 1,3) from the same foreign hospital. The incidence of CRKP-BSIs in the early stage (within 3 months) following kidney transplantation (KTx) from DCD was about 1.1% (3/275). In Case 1-3 and 5, the rupture of renal transplant artery was presented on the 40th, 16th, 43th and 74th day after KTx, and in Case 4, the thrombus of renal transplant artery was presented on the 13th day after KTx. Three cases (Case 1,2,5) occurring pneumothorax on the 45th, 51th and 32th day after KTx. Four cases (Case 1-4) received the excision of the transplanted kidney for the treatment. Polymerase chain reaction showed the bands for case 2 were distinctive from other cases. Pulse field gel electrophoresis showed mainly three clusters of the bands for all the isolates. Conclusions: During the study period, we observed an increase in the occurrence of CRKP-BSIs among KTRs from DCD in our hospital. We demonstrated that rupture/thrombus of the renal transplant artery was associated with CRKP-BSI in the early stage after KTx from DCD. Albeit the low incidence of CRKP-BSI (1.1%) after KTx from DCD, the high mortality (4/5) had been observed from the prognosis of the patients.

1566;29927830;Article;2018;Plastic and reconstructive surgery;;Living Donation of Vascularized Composite Allografts.;;Living donation has become a medically and ethically accepted practice in solid organ transplantation. Published proceedings from the international kidney transplant community and from the Ethics Committee of The Transplantation Society articulated the general principles and specific recommendations for living donation, which remain the backbone of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network requirements and policies. Meanwhile, there have been major advancements in another revolutionary field of transplant medicine: vascularized composite allotransplantation. Recent interventions have demonstrated potential for superior functional and aesthetic outcomes in a single operation when compared to staged conventional reconstructions. In view of these successes, the indications for vascularized composite allotransplantation are expected to broaden to include less extensive types of transplants, which would introduce the possibility of using living vascularized composite allotransplantation donors. In this article, the authors discuss the feasibility and ethics associated with living donation of vascularized composite allografts. The authors explore the current guidelines and policies set by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network regarding living organ donation. In addition, the authors provide several clinical scenarios in which living donation of vascularized composite allotransplantation  could be used to augment the reconstructive ladder currently used by reconstructive surgeons to guide their reconstructive strategies.;;Pomahac B, Alhefzi M, Bueno EM, McDiarmid SV, Levin LS;;eng;['Composite Tissue Allografts/*transplantation', 'Humans', '*Living Donors', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*standards', 'Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation/ethics/methods/*standards'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0000000000004659
1567;29921617;Article;2018;Journal of medical ethics;;Organismal death, the dead-donor rule and the ethics of vital organ procurement.;;Several bioethicists have recently discussed the complexity of defining human death, and considered in particular how our definition of death affects our understanding of the ethics of vital organ procurement. In this brief paper, we challenge the mainstream medical definition of human death-namely, that death is  equivalent to total brain failure-and argue with Nair-Collins and Miller that integrated biological functions can continue even after total brain failure has occurred. We discuss the implications of Nair-Collins and Miller's argument and suggest that it may be necessary to look for alternative biological markers that  reliably indicate the death of a human being. We reject the suggestion that we should abandon the dead-donor criteria for organ donation. Rather than weaken the ethical standards for vital organ procurement, it may be necessary to make them more demanding. The aim of this paper is not to justify the dead donor rule. Rather, we aim to explore the perspective of those who agree with critiques of the whole brain and cardiopulmonary definitions of death but yet disagree with the proposal that we should abandon the dead-donor rule.

1572;29913041;Article;2018;Xenotransplantation;;The ethics of organ donation, donation after circulatory determination of death,  and xenotransplantation from an Islamic perspective.;;"Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) and xenotransplantation  are advanced as possible solutions to the growing gap between the number of individuals in need of organ transplantation and the pool of donors. Investigating how various publics, including religious leaders, might view these  ""therapies"" is essential for broad public and professional support and will be needed in order to make these solutions viable. This study, therefore, presents normative Islamic bioethical perspectives on donation after circulatory determination of death and xenotransplantation. First, we will discuss foundational Islamic ethico-legal debates regarding organ donation. These debates can be grouped into three broad positions, those who consider organ donation categorically impermissible as a violation of human dignity (hurma and karama), those who agree that organ donation is impermissible in principle, but allow it conditionally on the basis of dire necessity (darura), and those who permit organ donation based on notions of public interest (maslaha). Next, we will reflect upon the additional ethical dimensions DCDD and xenotransplantation add to these  debates. We contend that the condition of minimal harm to the donor and the definition of death need to be accounted for within Islamic perspectives on DCDD. Xenotransplantation, on the other hand, highlights concerns about using pigs for  therapeutic purposes. We conclude by commenting on additional questions that remain to be addressed in the Islamic bioethical debate over these practices and  with recommendations for further research.";;Padela AI, Duivenbode R;;eng;['Animals', 'Heterografts/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Islam', 'Swine', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', '*Transplantation, Heterologous'];['*Islamic ethics', '*Muslims', '*cultural perspectives', '*theology'];;;10.1111/xen.12421

With this in mind, we examine the current state of hand transplantation research in the context of available alternatives. We examine the ethics of carrying out these operations in minors, including under the protections of clinical research.

Because familial relationships often entail distinctive experiences of moral obligation, health-care providers must be attentive to potential undue influences on intrafamilial donor decision-making processes to ensure that decisions are voluntary. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 individuals who donated kidneys to first-degree relatives and subsequently developed end-stage renal disease themselves. FINDINGS: We analyze the different  influences kinship obligations had on participants' decision-making processes. Although participants described their decision to donate as obvious, an appropriate kin response, and free from external pressure, they indirectly expressed some ambivalence-both by their description of the rapidity of the process and in their concern about exposing an intimate to the risks of living donation. DISCUSSION: Our data uncovered an asymmetry. Although our participants  claimed that they would donate again, none received a living donor kidney. Our data also highlight the moral significance of the interdependence of donor and recipient in intrafamilial kidney donation and its impact on the range of voluntary choices as perceived by the donor. Their decision-making must be understood as embedded within a network of intimate social relations.;;Halverson CME, Crowley-Matoka M, Ross LF;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', '*Altruism', 'Decision Making', 'Family Relations/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Motivation'];['*decision-making', '*ethics', '*intrafamilial relationships', '*kidney transplantation', '*living donors'];;;10.1177/1526924818781562

1577;29880339;Article;2018;Transplantation proceedings;;Twenty Years After Enactment of the Organ Transplant Law in Japan: Why Are There  Still So Few Deceased Donors?;;"BACKGROUND: Twenty years have passed since the 1997 enactment of the Organ Transplant Law in Japan, but the number of deceased donors remains extremely low. In this study we examine why deceased donation has continued to remain so infrequent. METHODS: This investigation was a secondary analysis of published data from the Japan Organ Transplant Network, 2016 Fact Book of Organ Transplantation in Japan, and International Registry on Organ Donation and Transplantation. RESULTS: In the past 20 years, donation intent declarations, knowledge, and respect for family member's wishes have increased, whereas resistance toward transplantation has decreased. Despite this, the traditional perspective on corpses of gotai manzoku (ie, the soul cannot be put to rest without being physically intact and without defect), the family-centricism, and reward-seeking altruism have not changed much. Living organ transplants have alleviated the organ deficiency somewhat, and the law requiring family consent seems to have contributed to the observed small increase in deceased donors. CONCLUSION: The number of deceased donors is unlikely to increase suddenly. However, 8 strategies are proposed to increase the number of deceased donors, including: increasing the number of donor procurement coordinators and establishing a training system; increasing the number of organ procurement facilities; creating hub transplant centers and training transplant surgeons; implementing radical reform in public education; reducing workload and improving  education of emergency physicians, neurosurgeons, and pediatricians; revisiting the stringent standards of brain-death determination; revisiting the registration process; and considering development of a Japanese version of organ procurement organizations as well as revisions to the Organ Transplant Law.

It is unknown how many patients are  disqualified from transplantation due to inadequate support, and whether providers feel confident using these subjective criteria to determine eligibility. Transplant providers (n = 551) from 202 centers estimated that, on average, 9.6% (standard deviation = 9.4) of patients evaluated in the prior year  were excluded due to inadequate support. This varied significantly by United Network for Organ Sharing region (7.6%-12.2%), and by center (21.7% among top quartile). Significantly more providers used social support in listing decisions  than believed it ought to be used (86.3% vs 67.6%). Nearly 25% believed that using social support in listing determinations was unfair or were unsure; 67.3% felt it disproportionately impacted patients of low socioeconomic status. Overall, 42.4% were only somewhat or not at all confident using social support to determine transplant suitability. Compared to surgical/medical transplant providers, psychosocial providers had 2.13 greater odds of supporting the criteria (P = .03).

Advancements of direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have allowed entertaining the use of viremic donor organs in nonviremic recipients. In this report, we describe the evolution of HCV treatment, ethics and informed consent, cost-effectiveness of HCV medications in treating acute HCV post-transplantation, and the Stanford experience with two HCV-viremic donor heart transplantations. We describe excellent short-term outcomes post-heart transplantation with HCV NAT-positive organs. The availability of this therapy may expand the donor pool. While we await larger-scale clinical data on the effectiveness and safety of DAA therapy in patients after heart transplantation,  many transplant centers have already started accepting organs from HCV-infected donors, balancing the unknown long-term risks versus the benefits of shorter wait times and expansion of the donor pool. Protocols and multidisciplinary teams are  needed to effectively communicate risk to potential recipients, to ensure timely  DAA access, and to implement appropriate clinical follow-up in order to achieve excellent clinical outcomes and to maximize the donor pool by utilizing HCV-infected organs for heart transplantation.;;Moayedi Y, Gulamhusein AF, Ross HJ, Teuteberg JJ, Khush KK;;eng;['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'California', '*Heart Transplantation', 'Hepacivirus/*drug effects', 'Hepatitis C/complications/*drug therapy/virology', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*standards'];['*direct-acting antiviral drugs', '*hepatitis C virus', '*increased risk donor'];;;10.1111/ctr.13308
1581;29852397;Article;2018;Social science & medicine (1982);;Organs and organisations: Situating ethics in organ donation after circulatory death in the UK.;;"Controlled organ donation after circulatory death (DCD) has recently been revived in the UK, as part of attempts to increase organ donation rates. The re-introduction of DCD has subsequently become the focus of bioethical controversy, since it necessitates intervening in the care of dying patients to obtain quality donor organs. Transplant policy responses to these concerns have generated new legal and ethical guidelines to address uncertainties around DCD, producing claims that the UK has overcome' the ethical challenge of DCD. In contrast, by drawing on Lynch's call to 'respecify' ethics, this paper argues that ethics in DCD cannot be reduced to abstract directives for practice, but, instead, are composed and dealt with as an organisational problem. To do this, I  utilise data from an ethnographic study examining the production of the 'minority ethnic organ donor' within UK organ donation settings; in particular, the data pertains to a case hospital which was in the process of developing a DCD programme during the period of fieldwork. Findings show that the ethics of DCD are encountered as practical sets of problems, constructed in relation to particular institutional locales. I describe how these issues are worked-around by creating conditions to make DCD organisationally possible, and through the animation of standard procedures into acceptable forms of practice. I argue that  ethics in DCD go far beyond normative bioethical principles, to encompass concerns around: the reputation of hospital Trusts, public perceptions of organ donation, the welfare of potential donor families, and challenges to the work of  health professionals caring for dying patients. The paper enriches understanding  of ethics in science and medicine by showing how ethics are assembled and negotiated as a practical-organisational concern, and calls for further examination of how DCD gets constructed as a potential problem and is made to happen in practice.";;Cooper J;;eng;['Death', 'Humans', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/organization & administration', 'United Kingdom'];['*Clinical guidelines', '*Death and dying', '*Ethics', '*Ethnography', '*Health professional practice', '*Organ donation', '*Organisations', '*Transplantation', '*United Kingdom'];;;10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.05.042

We studied the association between time to return to work and reported financial burden. Kidney donors who donated from 2/2005 through 12/2015 (n = 1012) were surveyed 6 months after donation and asked about occupation, time to return to work, and financial burden (on a 10-point Likert scale). Of 856 donors  working for pay, 629 (73%) responded. After adjusting for donor characteristics,  increased length of time to return to work was a significant predictor of financial burden (P < .001). It is notable that those in manual/skilled trade occupations, compared with all other occupations, experienced greater financial burden for each week away from work (P = .003). Older age at donation and nondirected (vs directed) donation were associated with significantly decreased financial burden.

1583;29791757;Article;2018;Clinical transplantation;;Organ donation after euthanasia, morally acceptable under strict procedural safeguards.;;In this paper, we will present a case of organ donation after active euthanasia (ODE) in the Netherlands from a patient who had his life ended at his explicit and voluntary request. The form of ODE we describe here concerns patients who are not unconscious and on life support, but who are conscious and want to have their life ended because of their hopeless and unbearable suffering, for instance due to a terminal illness such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This form of ODE is of course only possible in jurisdictions where euthanasia is allowed. In these jurisdictions, organ donation after euthanasia is an option that may be considered. We believe ODE is worthwhile to pursue, as it can strengthen patient autonomy, can give meaning to the inevitable death of the patient, and be an extra source of much needed donor organs. To ensure voluntariness of both euthanasia and organ donation and avoid conflict of  interest by physicians, ODE does need strict procedural safeguards however. The most important safeguard is a strict separation between the 2 procedures. The paper discusses several ethical issues such as who should broach the subject of organ donation and who should perform the euthanasia, and how a conflict of interest can be avoided.;;van Dijk G, van Bruchem-Visser R, de Beaufort I;;eng;['*Ethics, Medical', 'Euthanasia/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Physicians/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data'];['*ethics', '*guidelines', '*mental health'];;;10.1111/ctr.13294

1585;29771842;Article;2018;The Journal of craniofacial surgery;;Perceived Esthetic Outcomes of Face Transplantation: A Survey of the General Public.;;Facial transplantation (FT) has attracted the interest of individuals with facial disfigurement as a path to social reintegration. The perception among face transplant recipients and the reconstructive surgery community appears to be that superior functional and esthetic outcomes can be obtained with FT compared to autologous reconstruction (AR). Although lifelong immunosuppression adds well-known risks to FT, its benefits have proven difficult to quantify, especially because of its non-life-saving nature. Evidence that the general public perceives facial allograft recipients as less disfigured than AR patients  may dramatically alter the currently accepted risk/benefit ratio of this novel procedure. A survey containing independent images of individuals in nondisfigured (ND), autologous facial reconstruction, and FT groups was administered to the general public in an urban environment. Participants assigned a disfigurement score to each photograph using the Observer-Rated Facial Disfigurement Scale, a validated instrument used to rate facial disfigurement among head and neck cancer patients. One-way analysis of variance was used to calculate differences in mean  level of perceived facial disfigurement among the 3 groups. A total of 250 participants completed the survey. Mean perceived disfigurement scores assigned to the ND, FT, and AR groups were 1.2 +/- 0.4, 4.9 +/- 1.3, and 8.5 +/- 0.6, respectively. A significant difference in disfigurement score was observed between all 3 groups (P < 0.001).

1586;29764323;Article;2018;American journal of law & medicine;;Swaps and Chains and Vouchers, Oh My!: Evaluating How Saving More Lives Impacts the Equitable Allocation of Live Donor Kidneys.;;Live kidney donation involves a delicate balance between saving the most lives possible and maintaining a transplant system that is fair to the many thousands of patients on the transplant waiting list. Federal law and regulations require that kidney allocation be equitable, but the pressure to save patients subject to ever-lengthening waiting times for a transplant has been swinging the balance toward optimizing utility at the expense of justice. This article traces the progression of innovations created to make optimum use of a patient's own live donors. It starts with the simplest - direct donation by family members - and ends with voucher donations, a very recent and unique innovation because the donor can donate 20 or more years before the intended recipient is expected to need a kidney. In return for the donation, the intended recipient receives a voucher that can be redeemed for a live kidney when it is needed. Other innovations that are discussed include kidney exchanges and list paired donation, which are used to facilitate donor swaps when donor/recipient pairs have incompatible blood types. The discussion of each new innovation shows how the equity issues build on each other and how, with each new innovation, it becomes progressively harder to find an acceptable balance between utility and justice. The article culminates with an analysis of two recent allocation methods that have the potential to save many additional lives, but also affirmatively harm some patients on the deceased donor waiting list by increasing their waiting time for a life-saving kidney. The article concludes that saving additional lives does not justify harming patients on the waiting list unless that harm can be minimized. It also proposes solutions to minimize the harm so these new innovations can equitably perform their intended function of stimulating additional transplants and extending the lives of many transplant patients.;;Tenenbaum EM;;eng;['Directed Tissue Donation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Donor Selection/ethics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Liver Transplantation/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Living Donors/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1177/0098858818763812

However, a methodology for assessing system performance in providing equity in access to transplants was lacking. We present a novel approach for quantifying the degree of disparity in access to deceased donor kidney transplants among waitlisted patients and determine which factors are most associated with disparities. A Poisson rate regression model was built for each of 29 quarterly, period-prevalent cohorts (January 1, 2010-March 31, 2017; 5 years pre-kidney allocation system [KAS], 2 years post-KAS) of active kidney waiting list registrations. Inequity was quantified as the outlier-robust standard deviation (SDw ) of predicted transplant rates (log scale) among registrations, after ""discounting"" for intentional, policy-induced disparities (eg, pediatric priority) by holding such factors constant. The overall SDw declined by 40% after KAS implementation, suggesting substantially increased equity. Risk-adjusted, factor-specific disparities were measured with the SDw after holding all other factors constant. Disparities associated with calculated panel-reactive antibodies decreased sharply. Donor service area was the factor most associated with access disparities post-KAS. This methodology will help the transplant community evaluate tradeoffs between equity and utility-centric goals when considering new policies and help monitor equity in access as policies change.";;Stewart DE, Wilk AR, Toll AE, Harper AM, Lehman RR, Robinson AM, Noreen SA, Edwards EB, Klassen DK;;eng;['Adult', 'Cadaver', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Care Rationing/*standards', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Resource Allocation/*trends', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*trends', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Waiting Lists/*mortality'];['*Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)', '*disparities', '*donors and donation: deceased', '*ethics and public policy', '*health services and outcomes research', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*mathematical model', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;;10.1111/ajt.14922
1591;29728952;Article;2018;The international journal of cardiovascular imaging;;Myocardial perfusion reserve and global longitudinal strain as potential markers  of coronary allograft vasculopathy in late-stage orthotopic heart transplantation.;;Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major cause of mortality in late-stage orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) patients. Recent evidence has shown that myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) derived from vasodilator cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (vCMR) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) from transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are useful to detect CAV. However, previous  studies have not comprehensively addressed whether these parameters are confounded by allograft rejection, myocardial scar/fibrosis, or allograft dysfunction. Our aim was to determine whether changes in late post-OHT MPR and GLS are due to CAV or other confounding factors. Twenty OHT patients (time from transplant to vCMR was 8.1 +/- 4.1 years) and 30 controls (10 healthy volunteers  and 20 with prior myocardial infarction to provide perspective with regards to the severity of any abnormalities seen in post-OHT patients) underwent vasodilator vCMR from which MPR index (MPRi), left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF), and burden of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) were quantified. TTE was  used to measure GLS. The presence of CAV was determined from invasive coronary angiograms using thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) frame counts and grading severity per guidelines. Previous endomyocardial biopsies were reviewed to assess association with episodes of rejection. We examined the correlations between MPRi and GLS with markers of CAV, allograft function, scar/fibrosis, and  rejection. MPRi was abnormal in post-OHT patients compared to both healthy volunteers and MI controls. While there was no relationship between MPRi or GLS and LVEF, episodes of rejection, or LGE burden, both MPRi and GLS were associated with TIMI frame counts and presence and severity of CAV. Additionally, MPRi correlated with GLS (R = 0.68, P = 0.0002). In conclusion, MPRi and GLS are abnormal in late-stage OHT and associated with CAV, but not related to allograft  rejection, myocardial scar/fibrosis, or allograft dysfunction. Non-invasive monitoring of MPRi and GLS may be a useful strategy to detect CAV.;;Narang A, Blair JE, Patel MB, Mor-Avi V, Fedson SE, Uriel N, Lang RM, Patel AR;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts/blood supply/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Biopsy', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Artery Disease/*diagnostic imaging/etiology/physiopathology', '*Echocardiography/methods', 'Endocardium/pathology', 'Female', 'Heart/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Heart Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Perfusion Imaging/*methods', 'Myocardium/pathology'];['Allograft vasculopathy', 'Echocardiography', 'Heart transplantation', 'Longitudinal strain', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Myocardial perfusion'];;T32 HL007381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1007/s10554-018-1364-7

This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and the ethical issues surrounding organ transplantation and organ donation among healthcare personnel in Tehran, Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a cross-sectional study performed on 450 healthcare personnel, self-administered questionnaires were used to derive data from individuals. Among the 450 health personnel who received the questionnaires, 377 completed their questionnaires (83.77%). RESULTS The willingness and unwillingness to donate organs among individuals were 47.48% (n=179) and 52.51% (n=198), respectively. Among the individuals who signed the organ donation card, 96.5% (n=55) were willing to donate their organs and 3.5% (n=2) were unwilling to donate their organs. Most of the individuals that were willing (48.34%; n=175) and unwilling (51.66%; n=187) to donate their organs claimed religious support for organ donation (P=0.00). Out of these people, 110 willing people (67.48%) and 53 (32.52%) unwilling people were familiar with the idea of brain death. The individuals who selected cadavers (67.64%; n=255) and brain death (24.4%; n=92) were chosen as the best candidates  for organ donation. Most individuals believed that young patients (n=123; 32.62%) and people who had not already had organ transplants (n=90; 23.87%) should be the preferred recipients of organs. Most individuals had learned about organ transplantation from television (30.24%; n=114), newspapers (23.61%; n=89), and the radio (19.89%; n=75).

1594;29724118;Article;2018;AIDS care;;Perceptions, motivations, and concerns about living organ donation among people living with HIV.;;Recent changes to United States law now permit people living with HIV (PLWH) to donate organs to HIV-infected (HIV+) recipients under research protocols. PLWH may have unique motivations for and concerns about living donation and understanding them is critical to ensuring the integrity of this novel approach to organ transplantation. We conducted in-depth interviews with PLWH from an urban HIV clinic who had previously indicated their willingness to be a living donor. Interviews elicited information on their motivations, perceived benefits,  and concerns regarding living donation. Codes were identified inductively and then organized into themes and subthemes. Two coders independently analyzed the interviews and reconciled differences in coding by consensus. Thematic saturation was reached after 20 interviews. Motivations for living donation among PLWH included an altruistic desire to help others as well as HIV-specific motivations  including solidarity with potential recipients and a desire to overcome HIV-related stigma. Perceived benefits of living donation included gratification  from saving or improving the recipient's life and conferring a sense of normalcy  for the HIV+ donor. Concerns about donation included the possibility of a prolonged recovery period, organ failure, and transmission of another strain of the virus to the recipients. PLWH had unique motivations, perceived benefits, and concerns about living donation in addition to those previously identified in the  general population. These unique factors should be addressed in research protocols, informed consent processes, and the education and training of independent living donor advocates so that these endeavors are ethically sound.;;Van Pilsum Rasmussen SE, Henderson ML, Bollinger J, Seaman S, Brown D, Durand CM, Segev DL, Sugarman J;;eng;['Female', 'HIV Infections/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Motivation', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['*People living with HIV', '*ethics', '*living organ donation', '*organ donation'];;P30 AI094189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States;10.1080/09540121.2018.1469724

1596;29719565;Article;2018;Journal of biological engineering;;The rat pancreatic body tail as a source of a novel extracellular matrix scaffold for endocrine pancreas bioengineering.;;"Background: Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering are promising approaches for organ transplantation. Extracellular matrix (ECM) based scaffolds obtained through the decellularization of natural organs have become the preferred platform for organ bioengineering. In the field of pancreas bioengineering, acellular scaffolds from different animals approximate the biochemical, spatial and vascular relationships of the native extracellular matrix and have been proven to be a good platform for recellularization and in vitro culture. However, artificial endocrine pancreases based on these whole pancreatic scaffolds have a  critical flaw, specifically their difficult in vivo transplantation, and connecting their vessels to the recipient is a major limitation in the development of pancreatic tissue engineering. In this study, we focus on preparing a novel acellular extracellular matrix scaffold derived from the rat pancreatic body tail (pan-body-tail ECM scaffold). Results: Several analyses confirmed that our protocol effectively removes cellular material while preserving ECM proteins and the native vascular tree. DNA quantification demonstrated an obvious reduction of DNA compared with that of the natural organ  (from 931.9 +/- 267.8 to 11.7 +/- 3.6 ng/mg, P < 0.001); the retention of the sGAG in the decellularized pancreas (0.878 +/- 0.37) showed no significant difference from the natural pancreas (0.819 +/- 0.1) (P > 0.05). After transplanted with the recellularized pancreas, fasting glucose levels declined to 9.08 +/- 2.4 mmol/l within 2 h of the operation, and 8 h later, they had decreased to 4.7 +/- 1.8 mmol/l (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The current study describes a novel pancreatic ECM scaffold prepared from the rat pancreatic body tail via perfusion through the left gastric artery. We further showed the pioneering possibility of in vivo circulation-connected transplantation of a recellularized pancreas based on this novel scaffold. By providing such a promising pancreatic ECM scaffold, the present study might represent a key improvement and have a positive impact on endocrine pancreas bioengineering.";;Yu H, Chen Y, Kong H, He Q, Sun H, Bhugul PA, Zhang Q, Chen B, Zhou M;;eng;;['Decellularization', 'Extracellular matrix scaffold', 'Organ bioengineering', 'Recellularization', 'Transplantation'];All animal work was performed according to the Animal Welfare Act and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at Wenzhou Medical University,and the reference number is wydw2016-0224.No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript, and manuscript is approved by all authors for publication.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.;;10.1186/s13036-018-0096-5

We identified 14 kidney transplant (KT) programs with SIAs and 28 KT programs without SIAs matched on waitlist volume and characterized kidney acceptance using SRTR data from 12/2006-3/2015. We used difference-in-differences linear regression models to identify changes in acceptance associated with an SIA independent of program variation and trends prior to the SIA. SIA programs accepted 26.9% and 22.1% of offers pre- and post-SIA, while non-SIA programs accepted 33.9% and 44.4% of offers in matched time periods. After adjustment for  donor characteristics, time-varying waitlist volume, and secular trends, SIAs were associated with a 5.9 percentage-point (22%) decrease in kidney acceptance (95% CI: -10.9 to -0.8, P = .03). The decrease in acceptance post-SIA was more pronounced for KDPI 0-40 kidneys (12.3 percentage-point decrease, P = .007); reductions in acceptance of higher KDPI kidneys occurred pre-SIA. Programs undergoing SIAs substantially reduced acceptance of kidney offers for waitlisted  candidates.

Often, sociocultural practices, which are thought to be fundamentally opposed to  deceased organ donation, are hailed as the cause. However, other factors such as  context, social perceptions, and clinical environment may play a role. AIM: The aim of this article is to present research that explored communication in organ transplant and identified barriers to organ donation decisions in a province of South Africa. METHODS: Qualitative methods were used. Thirty semistructured interviews with transplant professionals and 2 focus groups with transplant coordinators took place across 6 health institutions in Gauteng Province. RESULTS: Barriers that may prevent transplant professionals from referring potential donors were identified: The wider public and transplant professionals may be suspicious of biomedicine and have a perception that people could be killed for their organs. Organ donation was sometimes framed as ""murder,"" ""killing,"" or a ""bunch of vultures."" Doctors may be unwilling to refer brain-dead patients, as this was seen as failing in one's professional duty to cure the patient. The role of sociocultural practices was inconclusive, with the sample divided based on the extent of their influence. CONCLUSION: Low donor numbers may be a manifestation of barriers to referral in the clinical setting. These barriers interplay in a context of suspicion and are framed by a clinical transplant discourse that is sometimes loaded with negative connotation. Sociocultural practices are influential, but they may not be the overriding cause of low donor numbers.";;Etheredge HR, Penn C, Watermeyer J;;eng;['Adult', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*psychology', '*Referral and Consultation', 'South Africa', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];['*access', '*and evaluation', '*body regions', '*communication', '*deceased', '*donor referral', '*ethics', '*health-care quality', '*organ donation', '*organ transplant', '*qualitative research', '*transplant discourse', '*transplant donor'];;;10.1177/1526924818765819

Patient casemix and patterns of critical illnesses, and probably also ventilation practices are likely to be different in  resource-limited settings. We aim to investigate the epidemiological characteristics, ventilation practices and clinical outcomes of patients receiving mechanical ventilation in ICUs in Asia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PRoVENT-iMIC (study of PRactice of VENTilation in Middle-Income Countries) is an  international multicentre observational study to be undertaken in approximately 60 ICUs in 11 Asian countries. Consecutive patients aged 18 years or older who are receiving invasive ventilation in participating ICUs during a predefined 28-day period are to be enrolled, with a daily follow-up of 7 days. The primary outcome is ventilatory management (including tidal volume expressed as mL/kg predicted body weight and positive end-expiratory pressure expressed as cm H2O) during the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation-compared between patients at no risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), patients at risk for ARDS and in patients with ARDS (in case the diagnosis of ARDS can be made on admission). Secondary outcomes include occurrence of pulmonary complications and  all-cause ICU mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: PRoVENT-iMIC will be the first international study that prospectively assesses ventilation practices, outcomes and epidemiology of invasively ventilated patients in ICUs in Asia. The results of this large study, to be disseminated through conference presentations and publications in international peer-reviewed journals, are of ultimate importance  when designing trials of invasive ventilation in resource-limited ICUs. Access to source data will be made available through national or international anonymised datasets on request and after agreement of the PRoVENT-iMIC steering committee.

Concerns over these and further planned revisions to policy include predicted decrease in total transplants, increased flying and logistical complexity, adverse impact on areas with poor quality health care, and minimal effect on high MELD donor service areas. To address these issues, we describe general approaches to equalize critical transplant metrics among regions and determine how they alter MELD variance at transplant and organ supply to underserved communities. We show an allocation system that increases minimum MELD for local allocation or preferentially directs organs into areas of need decreases MELD variance. Both models have minimal adverse effects on flying and total transplants, and do not disproportionately disadvantage already underserved communities. When combined together, these approaches decrease MELD variance by 28%, more than the recently adopted proposal. These models can be adapted for any measure of variance, can be combined with other proposals, and can be configured  to automatically adjust to changes in disease incidence as is occurring with hepatitis C and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.;;Ye F, Sheng Q, Feurer ID, Zhao Z, Fan R, Teng J, Ping J, Rega SA, Hanto DW, Shyr Y, Karp SJ;;eng;['End Stage Liver Disease/*surgery', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Care Rationing/*standards', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', '*Needs Assessment', '*Patient Selection', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Resource Allocation/*standards', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Waiting Lists'];['*United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)', '*clinical research/practice', '*ethics and public policy', '*law/legislation', '*liver transplantation/hepatology', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.14889

A Focus on Turkey's Current System.;;"Kidney transplantation is a lifesaving medical treatment. However, very high demand for kidneys with low kidney donation causes a black market that exploits patients' desperation and donors' vulnerability. The current kidney donation programs fail to produce promising results to avoid illegal and unethical kidney  trafficking and commercialism. Even though the primary goal of kidney donation is to increase the number of deceased organ donations, in some countries, like Turkey, due to religious or cultural concerns, it is impossible to supply adequate deceased kidney donations. In this view, the aim of this paper is to examine kidney trafficking in the scope of Turkey's current organ donation system and propose a new model, named the Incentivized Kidney Donation Model (IKDM), to  increase kidney donation from living donors. The model encompasses the following  benefits offered to kidney donors; lifetime health insurance, exemptions from copayments/contribution shares, priority when receiving an organ, priority when finding a job, income tax exemptions for salaried employees, and free or discounted public utilities.

Unfortunately, there are no large trials guiding treatment for recurrent FSGS. We aimed to describe current therapies and treatment response for recurrent FSGS in 4 centres in Australia and New Zealand. Data were collected on children (age <18 years) with recurrent FSGS  (1990-2015). We reviewed patient charts to obtain clinical information. Ethics approval was obtained from the relevant boards. Complete records were available on 24 patients (62% female, 54% Caucasian). Median time to first recurrence was 4 days (IQR 2-5 days). There were 14 separate treatment regimens, involving an average of 2 agents. The most common therapies were plasma exchange (20/24 patients, 83%), cyclosporin (15/24, 63%), and methylprednisolone (9/24, 38%). Full remission was achieved in 15 (63%), partial remission in 2 (8%), and no remission in 7 (29%) patients. Of the patients with no remission, 5 lost their graft to recurrent disease and 1 to concurrent acute vascular rejection. The plethora of different treatment regimens reflects the poor evidence guiding management for recurrent FSGS.

Although conventional reconstruction can have positive effects with respect to identity, these procedures are often inadequate for more severe facial defects. In these cases, facial transplantation (FT) offers patients a viable reconstructive option. However, FT's effect on personal identity has been less well examined, and ethical questions remain regarding the psychosocial ramifications of the procedure. This article reviews the literature on the different roles of the face as well as psychological and social effects of facial disfigurement. The effects of facial reconstruction on personal identity are also reviewed with an emphasis on orthognathic, cleft, and head and neck surgery.

This system may encourage centers to overtreat candidates. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe national variation in the intensity of treatment of adult heart transplantation candidates and identify center-level predictors of potential overtreatment. METHODS: The registrations of all U.S. adult heart transplantation candidates from 2010 to 2015 were collected from the SRTR (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients). ""Potential overtreatment"" was defined as treatment of a candidate who did not meet American Heart Association cardiogenic shock criteria  with either high-dose inotropes or an intra-aortic balloon pump. Multilevel logistic regression and propensity score models were used to adjust for candidate variability at each center. Center-level variables associated with potential overtreatment were identified. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2015, 108 centers listed 12,762 adult candidates who were not in cardiogenic shock for heart transplantation. Of these, 1,471 (11.6%) were potentially overtreated with high-dose inotropes or intra-aortic balloon pumps. In the bottom quartile of centers, only 2.1% of candidates were potentially overtreated compared with 27.6% at top quartile centers, an interquartile difference of 25.5% (95% confidence interval: 21% to 30%). Adjusting for candidate differences did not significantly  alter the interquartile difference. Local competition with 2 or more centers increased the odds of potential overtreatment by 50% (adjusted odds ratio: 1.50;  95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 2.11). CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in the treatment practices of adult heart transplantation centers. Competition for transplantable donor hearts is associated with the potential overtreatment of hemodynamically stable candidates. Overtreatment may compromise the fair and efficient allocation of scarce deceased donor hearts.";;Parker WF, Anderson AS, Hedeker D, Huang ES, Garrity ER Jr, Siegler M, Churpek MM;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medical Overuse', 'Middle Aged', 'Propensity Score', '*Registries', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'United States'];['*ethics', '*heart transplantation', '*organ allocation'];;T32 HL007605/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1016/j.jacc.2018.02.030

This retrospective single center cohort study aimed at analyzing the effect of vitamin D and covariates on the slope of 1/creatinine after the first year. MATERIAL AND METHODS After ethics committee approval, 37 (14 male) pediatric renal transplant recipients on mycophenolate mofetil, who were followed between 2006 and 2014, were included in this study. We analyzed the slope of 1/creatinine, length of follow-up, average vitamin D levels, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase levels, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and therapeutic drug monitoring parameters. RESULTS Median  slope of 1/creatinine was -2.587e-006 L/micromol. We divided the 37 patients into two groups based on slope: 18 patients with a poorer slope and 19 patients with a good slope, with the median slope of 1/creatinine being significantly different between the two groups. Creatinine and cystatin C at one-year post-transplantation did not differ between the two groups. Average vitamin D levels were 71.4+/-31.01 pmol/L and identical in each group (averages 71.67 and 69.23 pmol/L, respectively). Only the mycophenolic acid coefficient of variation  (MPA CV), which may promote formation of donor-specific antibodies, and PTH levels were significantly associated with 1/creatinine slope. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the impact of mild and moderate decreased levels of vitamin D can have a mild impact on the progression of allograft dysfunction in transplant  recipients. However, given the medication burden and adherence challenges in adolescents, correction of mildly decreased vitamin D levels may not be necessary.;;Wile B, Yoo E, Alvarez Elias AC, Subramanian L, Eager K, Sharma AP, Filler G;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/complications/physiopathology/therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Male', 'Mycophenolic Acid/blood/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vitamin D/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/complications/drug therapy/physiopathology'];;;;

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of preconditioning after hepatic I-R in Wistar rats, through mitochondrial respiration, liver histology, and profile. METHOD: Twenty male Wistar rats, weighing on average 307.1 g, were anesthetized with sodium thiopental (25 mg/kg) intravenously and xylazine hydrochloride (30 mg/kg)  intramuscularly. The animals were divided into 2 groups: the preconditioning group (PCG), which contained 10 animals, and the hepatic pedicle was isolated and submitted to clamping with microvascular clamp (10 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion, followed by 30 minutes of ischemia and 30 minutes of reperfusion); and the simulated operation group (SOG), which contained 10 animals submitted to manipulation of the hepatic pedicle and observation for the same length of time, with blood collected for transaminase dosage measurements, and liver biopsy for evaluation of mitochondrial respiration and histologic liver analysis and after sacrificed under anesthesia. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation CEEA/UNICAMP under protocol number 3905-1. RESULT: The PCG mitochondria showed the same respiration level as the SOG, when stimulated with the addition of adenosine diphosphate or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. In the respiratory control ratio and resting of velocity of respiration the groups behaved in a similar way. The PCG presented high aspartate and alanine transaminases (P < .03) and about 60% of sinusoidal congestion and venous congestion in the histologic analysis when compared with SOG. CONCLUSION: We found that ischemia with preconditioning in Wistar rats can lead to mild histologic and biochemical dysfunction without leading to impairment of mitochondrial respiration.";;Tartaro RR, Jorge GL, Dianin AH, Escanhoela CAF, Boin IFSF;;eng;['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/physiopathology', 'Constriction', 'Ischemia/*physiopathology', 'Ischemic Preconditioning/*adverse effects/methods', 'Liver/*blood supply', 'Liver Circulation', 'Liver Neoplasms/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reperfusion', 'Reperfusion Injury/physiopathology/prevention & control', '*Respiration'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.02.026

The Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP) is an interdisciplinary research team looking at a variety of issues related to organ and tissue donation and transplantation. The aim of this study was to gather the perspectives of CNTRP researchers on engaging patients in research.We conducted interviews with 10 researchers who attended a national workshop on priority-setting in organ donation and transplant research.  The researchers viewed patient engagement in research as necessary and important. They also considered that patients could be engaged at every step of the research process. Participants in this study identified scientific language, time, money,  power imbalance, patient selection and risk of tokenism as potential barriers to  patient engagement in research. Training, adequate resources and support from the institution were identified as facilitators of patient engagement.This study showed a positive attitude among researchers in the field of organ donation and transplantation. Further studies are needed to study the implementation and impact of patient engagement in research within the CNTRP. Abstract: Background Involving patients in research has been acknowledged as a way to enhance the quality, relevance and transparency of medical research. No previous studies have looked at researchers' perspectives on patient engagement (PE) in organ donation  and transplant research in Canada. Objective The aim of this study was to gather  the perspectives of Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP) researchers on PE in research. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten researchers who attended a national workshop on priority-setting in organ donation and transplant research. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were subjected to qualitative thematic and content analyses. Results The researchers viewed PE in research as necessary and important. PE was a method to incorporate the voice of the patient. They also considered that patients could be engaged at every step of the research process. The following were identified as the main barriers to PE in research: (i) scientific jargon; (ii) resources (time and money); (iii) tokenism; (iv) power imbalance; and (v) patient selection. Facilitating factors included (i) training for patients and researchers, (ii) adequate resources and (iii) institutional support. Conclusion This study revealed a favourable attitude and willingness among CNTRP researchers to engage and partner with patients in research.

METHODS: In a case study, the patients' charts were analysed retrospectively. In structured interviews, parents and patients were asked about their flight routes to Germany, their medical treatment and their integration. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2013, eight  children and adolescents with renal failure were treated with dialysis or renal transplantation in Erlangen. Most patients came with the help of human traffickers and a tourist visa. They often told that they had lost their papers in the excitement. One family received new passports from the trafficker with fake names and birth dates. The families had to pay high amounts of money in order to save their child's life. Although dialysis therapy was often difficult because of lower adherence, the overall course was satisfactory. Four patients have been transplanted successfully so far. CONCLUSION: This case study reveals new facets of patient mobility, since leaving home was the only way for the family to ensure their child s survival. An ethical problems arose, as a chronic  dialysis treatment in children seems ethically only justifiable if a kidney transplant is the therapeutic goal. .;;Mammadova D, Marek I, Galiano M, Rascher W;;ger;['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Europe, Eastern/ethnology', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/ethnology/*therapy', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Medical Tourism', 'Renal Dialysis/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies'];;Die Autoren erklaren hiermit, dass kein Interessenkonflikt besteht.;;10.1055/s-0044-101547

The aim of this study was to compare two methods, a particle enhanced turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (PETINIA) and a reference liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for determining plasma MPA concentrations from Japanese lung transplant recipients. Methods: Plasma MPA concentrations were determined from 20 Japanese lung transplant recipients using LC-MS/MS and the PETINIA on the Dimension Xpand Plus-HM analyzer. Results: The mean MPA concentration measured by PETINIA was significantly higher than that measured by LC-MS/MS (3.26 +/- 2.73 mug/mL versus 2.82 +/- 2.71 mug/mL, P < 0.0001). The result of the Passing Bablok analysis was a slope of 1.104 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.036-1.150) and an  intercept of 0.229 (95%CI, 0.144-0.315). Bland-Altman analysis revealed PETINIA overestimates plasma MPA concentration by 26.25% and 95%CI from 21.43 to 31.07%.

1622;29605864;Article;2018;Journal of robotic surgery;;Robotic kidney autotransplantation in a porcine model: a procedure-specific training platform for the simulation of robotic intracorporeal vascular anastomosis.;;Robotic-assisted kidney transplantation (RKT) with the Da Vinci (Intuitive, USA)  platform has been recently developed to improve outcomes by decreasing surgical site complications and morbidity, especially in obese patients. This potential paradigm shift in the surgical technique of kidney transplantation is performed in only a few centers. For wider adoption of this high stake complex operation, we aimed to develop a procedure-specific simulation platform in a porcine model for the training of robotic intracorporeal vascular anastomosis and evaluating vascular anastomoses patency. This paper describes the requirements and steps developed for the above training purpose. Over a series of four animal ethics' approved experiments, the technique of robotic-assisted laparoscopic autotransplantation of the kidney was developed in Amsterdam live pigs (60-70 kg). The surgery was based around the vascular anastomosis technique described by Menon et al. This non-survival porcine training model is targeted at transplant surgeons with robotic surgery experience. Under general anesthesia, each pig was  placed in lateral decubitus position with the placement of one robotic camera port, two robotic 8 mm ports and one assistant port. Robotic docking over the pig posteriorly was performed. The training platform involved the following procedural steps. First, ipsilateral iliac vessel dissection was performed. Second, robotic-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was performed with in situ perfusion of the kidney with cold Hartmann's solution prior to complete division of the hilar vessels, ureter and kidney mobilization. Thirdly, the kidney was either kept in situ for orthotopic autotransplantation or mobilized to the pelvis and orientated for the vascular anastomosis, which was performed end to end or end to side after vessel loop clamping of the iliac vessels, respectively, using 6/0 Gore-Tex sutures. Following autotransplantation and release of vessel loops, perfusion of the graft was assessed using intraoperative indocyanine green imaging and monitoring urine output after unclamping. This training platform demonstrates adequate face and content validity. With practice, arterial anastomotic time could be improved, showing its construct validity. This porcine training model can be useful in providing training for robotic intracorporeal vascular anastomosis and may facilitate confident translation into a transplant human recipient.;;Tiong HY, Goh BYS, Chiong E, Tan LGL, Vathsala A;;eng;['Anastomosis, Surgical', 'Animals', 'Iliac Artery/surgery', 'Iliac Vein/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/education/*methods', 'Models, Animal', 'Nephrectomy/methods', 'Renal Artery/*surgery', 'Renal Veins/*surgery', 'Robotic Surgical Procedures/education/*methods', 'Swine', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vascular Patency'];['Porcine simulation training model', 'Robotic kidney transplantation'];;Robotic Research Grant/Intuitive Surgical;10.1007/s11701-018-0806-5

We examined waitlisting pre- and post-KAS among incident (N = 1 253 100) and prevalent (N = 1 556 954) ESRD patients from the United States Renal Data System  database (2005-2015) using multivariable time-dependent Cox and interrupted time-series models. The adjusted waitlisting rate among incident patients was 9%  lower post-KAS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.93), although preemptive waitlisting increased from 30.2% to 35.1% (P < .0001). The waitlisting decrease is largely due to a decline in inactively waitlisted patients. Pre-KAS, blacks had a 19% lower waitlisting rate vs whites (HR: 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.82); following KAS, disparity declined to 12% (HR: 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.90). In adjusted time-series analyses of prevalent patients, waitlisting rates declined by 3.45/10 000 per month post-KAS (P < .001), resulting in approximately 146 fewer waitlisting events/month. Shorter dialysis vintage was associated with greater decreases in waitlisting post-KAS (P < .001).

Long-term prognosis after pediatric cardiac  and/or pulmonary transplant is conditioned by the occurrence of graft failure, coronary disease of the cardiac graft, viral infections and bronchiolitis obliterans of the pulmonary graft, the incidence of which increase with time. The scarcity of grafts and the risk of acute rejection due to lack of compliance with immunosuppressive treatment require the transplant specialized teams to choose the best candidates according to psychosocial and biological criteria. The next expected developments concern mainly long-term ventricular assistance with systems that allow for greater autonomy and a return to the child's home.;;Hascoet S, Boet A, Nubret K, Lilot M, Feuillet S, Benbrik N, Guihaire J, Le Bret E, Fadel E, Fouilloux V, Amedro P, Houyel L, Kreitmann B;;fre;['Child', '*Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation/ethics/instrumentation', 'Heart Failure/complications/*surgery', '*Heart-Lung Transplantation/ethics', 'Humans', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/complications/*surgery'];;;;10.1016/j.lpm.2018.01.014
1627;29579766;Article;2018;Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine;;How Should Lungs Be Allocated for Transplant?;;As lung transplantation became established therapy for end-stage lung disease, there were not nearly enough suitable lungs from brain-dead organ donors to meet  the need, leading to a focus on how lungs are allocated for transplant. Originally lungs were allocated by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) like hearts-by waiting time, first to listed recipients in the organ procurement  organization of the donor, then to potential recipients in concentric 500 nautical mile circles. This resulted in long waiting times and increasing waitlist deaths. In 1999, the Health Resources and Services Administration published a Final Rule, requesting UNOS to review organ allocation algorithms to  ensure that they complied with the desire to allocate organs based on urgency, avoiding futile transplants, and minimizing the role of waiting time in organ allocation. This led to development of the lung allocation score (LAS), which allocates lungs based on urgency and transplant benefit, introduced in 2005. The  U.S. LAS system was adopted by Eurotransplant to allocate unused lungs between donor countries, and by both Germany and the Netherlands for lung allocation in their countries. This article will review the history of lung allocation, discuss the impact of LAS and its shortcomings, suggest recommendations to increase the number of lungs for transplant, and improve allocation of donated lungs. Ultimately, the goal of organ transplant research is to have so many organs to transplant that allocation systems are unnecessary.;;Egan TM;;eng;['Algorithms', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/mortality/*surgery', '*Lung Transplantation', '*Patient Selection', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*organization & administration', 'United States', 'Waiting Lists/mortality'];;Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.;;10.1055/s-0037-1620265

Current above-elbow prostheses may restore basic motor functions for crucial activities, but they are cumbersome to operate, lack sensory feedback, and are often abandoned. Targeted muscle reinnervation is a novel surgical procedure that enhances the ability of patients with above-elbow amputations to intuitively control a myoelectric prosthesis. By transferring multiple severed peripheral nerves to a robust target muscle, targeted muscle reinnervation restores physiologic continuity and enables more intuitive prosthetic control. Although reports have been limited to adults, targeted muscle reinnervation has great potential for application in a pediatric population with congenital or acquired proximal upper limb absence. In this review, the authors describe the rehabilitative challenges of proximal upper limb amputees and outline the objectives, techniques, and outcomes of targeted muscle reinnervation. The authors then discuss important considerations for adapting targeted muscle reinnervation to pediatric patients, including cause of upper limb absence, central plasticity, timing of prosthesis fitting, role of the family, surgical feasibility, and bioethical aspects. The authors believe that carefully screened  school-age children and adolescents with bilateral proximal upper limb absence, and select adolescents with unilateral proximal upper limb absence, should be seriously considered for targeted muscle reinnervation performed by an experienced surgical and rehabilitation team.;;Zuo KJ, Willand MP, Ho ES, Ramdial S, Borschel GH;;eng;['Adaptation, Physiological/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arm/*abnormalities/innervation', '*Artificial Limbs', 'Child', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Family', 'Feedback, Sensory/physiology', 'Female', 'Hand Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*innervation', 'Nerve Regeneration/*physiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/physiology', 'Patient Compliance', 'Patient Selection', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Social Support', 'Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation/methods', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1097/PRS.0000000000004370

In many countries around the world, neurological criteria can be used to legally determine death (also referred to as brain death). Nevertheless, there is considerable controversy in the bioethics literature over whether brain death is  the equivalent of biological death. This international legal review demonstrates  that there is considerable variability in how different jurisdictions have evolved to justify the legal status of brain death and its relationship to the dead-donor rule. In this article, we chose to review approaches that are representative of many different jurisdictions-the United States takes an approach similar to that of many European countries; the United Kingdom's approach is followed by Canada, India, and influences many other Commonwealth countries; Islamic jurisprudence is applicable to several different national laws; the Israeli approach is similar to many Western countries, but incorporates noteworthy modifications; and Japan's relatively idiosyncratic approach has received some attention in the literature. Illuminating these different justifications may help develop respectful policies regarding organ donation within countries with diverse populations and allow for more informed debate about brain death and the dead-donor rule.";;Aramesh K, Arima H, Gardiner D, Shah SK;;eng;['Brain Death/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Islam', 'Israel', 'Japan', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];;;;
1630;29553445;Article;2018;Lancet (London, England);;Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Palestinian people relating to organ donation in 2016: a cross-sectional study.;;BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for organ failure, but organs are scarce and their availability is affected by relational ties, religious beliefs, cultural influences, body integrity, medical mistrust, and other factors. This aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Palestinian population with respect to organ donation. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used a validated questionnaire delivered by land telephone to collect data on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to  organ donation in the general population of the West Bank. Stratified sampling and simple random sampling were applied using data obtained from the Palestinian  Telecommunication Group in 2016. Stata version 20 was used for statistical analysis, and a p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of An-Najah National University, and all participants gave verbal informed consent. FINDINGS: The questionnaire was completed by 385 (68%) of 565 people approached (mean age 42 years [SD 14.13]). 266 (69%) respondents were married, 311 (80%) were employed, and 375 (97%) were Muslim. 136 (35%) respondents were university students or post-graduates. Half of participants lived in urban areas. Local religious clergy were reported as being the source of general information by 150 (40%) participants. 273 (71%) respondents had adequate knowledge about organ donation,  TV being the main source of information for 207 (60%) participants. 70 (26%) respondents would consider donation only after death, and 342 (67%) respondents would only consider donating to a close family member, whereas 341 (100%) respondents believed that their organ could be misused and 219 (64%) believed organ donation carries a health risk. 135 (49%) respondents preferred to donate to a recipient of the same religion. 266 (78%) individuals believed that organ donation should be promoted in the occupied Palestinian territory, although 188 (55%) reported organ donation to be culturally unacceptable. Religious beliefs and fears of complications were the main obstacles to organ donation. An adequate level of knowledge was associated with the female sex (p=0.008), level of education (p=0.046), monthly income (p=0.041), and marital status (p=0.012), whereas a positive attitude to organ donation was associated with religious score (p=0.015), marital status (p=0.031), and knowledge score (p=0.003). A high level  of knowledge was associated with employment and the perception of organ donation  as permitted in religion, whereas a positive attitude was associated with single  marital status, high level of knowledge, and residence in cities. INTERPRETATION: Despite adequate knowledge and positive attitudes towards organ donation, a comprehensive study is necessary to fully understand the local characteristics that influence organ donation by Palestinians and to better inform decision makers and future policies.

Social media provides a platform  for changing non-identifiable 'statistical victims' into 'real people' with whom  we can identify and feel empathy: the so-called 'identifiable victim effect', which prompts charitable action. We examine three approaches to promoting kidney  donation using social media which could take advantages of the identifiable victim effect: (a) institutionally organized campaigns based on historical cases  aimed at promoting non-directed altruistic donation; (b) personal case-based campaigns organized by individuals aimed at promoting themselves/or someone with  whom they are in a relationship as a recipient of directed donation; (c) institutionally organized personal case-based campaigns aimed at promoting specific recipients for directed donation. We will highlight the key ethical issues raised by these approaches, and will argue that the third option, despite  raising ethical concerns, is preferable to the other two.";;Moorlock G, Draper H;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Directed Tissue Donation/*ethics', 'Empathy/ethics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Motivation', 'Social Media', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics'];['*altruism', '*empathy', '*kidney', '*organ donation', '*social media', '*transplant'];;;10.1111/bioe.12438

Of the remaining 1247 respondents, 977 (78%) supported and 48 (4%) opposed allowing women to undergo UTx. Respondents with higher yearly incomes and education level were more likely to agree that ""taking the uterus from one person and putting it into another person is ethical."" Respondents who answered that UTx is safe for the donor, recipient, and baby were more likely to believe that UTx is an acceptable, ethical alternative to a gestational carrier. Forty-five percent of respondents believed that UTx should be covered by insurance, whereas  24% did not. CONCLUSION: The majority of respondents in a sample of US residents  support UTx, find it ethical, and believe that it is an acceptable alternative to a gestational carrier although support varies.

1636;29510570;Article;2018;Journal of clinical medicine;;"Organ Transplantation in Iran; Current State and Challenges with a View on Ethical Consideration.";;Organ transplantation is a new issue in medical science. It is an important achievement and a sign of the progression and ability of medical centers around the world. Governments, populations, the medical community and people involved in culture, art, and media all have a decisive role in the culture of organ donation, which is the only way to guarantee that the healthy organs of a brain-dead person can continue to work and save the lives of people in need of organ transplantation. The brain death phenomenon and its possible application in organ transplantation, while offering new hope for the salvation of a number of patients, has led to many ethical, cultural, and legal issues. Ethical issues in  organ transplantation are very complicated due to many social factors such as religion, culture, and traditions of the affected communities. The ethical and legal points of removing organs from the body of a living or cadaveric source, the definition of brain death, the moral and legal conditions of the donor and the recipient, and the financial relationship between them and many others, are all critical issues in organ transplantation. While there may be no available explicit solution to these issues, they should be rigorously considered by the experts. Efforts to systematically eliminate barriers and solve problems in organ transplantation, can not only reduce the costs of maintaining brain-dead patients and encourage patients that need organ transplantation but can also prevent immoral and illegal activities. In this paper, we have reviewed the most important and current challenges in organ transplantation with a view to the ethical considerations, and we have suggested some strategies to extend it in Iran.;;Kiani M, Abbasi M, Ahmadi M, Salehi B;;eng;;['brain death', 'ethical issues', 'extension of organ transplantation', 'organ donation', 'organ transplantation'];The authors declare no conflict of interest.;;10.3390/jcm7030045

The new national kidney allocation system (KAS) preferentially allocates  blood group A2/A2B deceased donor kidneys to B recipients to address this ethnic  and blood group disparity. No study has yet examined the impact of KAS on A2 incompatible (A2i) DDKT for blood group B recipients overall or among minorities. A case-control study of adult blood group B DDKT recipients from 2013 to 2017 was performed, as reported to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Cases were defined as recipients of A2/A2B kidneys, whereas controls were all remaining recipients of non-A2/A2B kidneys. A2i DDKT trends were compared from the pre-KAS  (1/1/2013-12/3/2014) to the post-KAS period (12/4/2014-2/28/2017) using multivariable logistic regression. Post-KAS, there was a 4.9-fold increase in the likelihood of A2i DDKT, compared to the pre-KAS period (odds ratio [OR] 4.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.67-6.60). However, compared to whites, there was no difference in the likelihood of A2i DDKT among minorities post-KAS. Although KAS  resulted in increasing A2/A2B-->B DDKT, the likelihood of A2i DDKT among minorities, relative to whites, was not improved.

DT improves both the quality of life and prognosis of patients with end-stage heart failure. However, there are also downsides to DT such as life-threatening complications and the potential for the patient to live beyond their desired length of life following such major complications. Because of deeply ingrained cultural and religious beliefs regarding death and the sanctity of life, Japanese society may not be ready to make changes needed to enable patients to have LVADs deactivated under certain circumstances to avoid needless suffering. MAIN TEXT: Western ethical views that  permit LVAD deactivation based mainly on respect for autonomy and dignity have not been accepted thus far in Japan and are unlikely to be accepted, given the current Japanese culture and traditional values. Some healthcare professionals might regard patients as ineligible for DT unless they have prepared advance directives. If this were to happen, the right to prepare an advance directive would instead become an obligation to do so. Furthermore, patient selection for DT poses another ethical issue. Given the predominant sanctity of life principle  and lack of cost-consciousness regarding medical expenses, medically appropriate  exclusion criteria would be ignored and DT could be applied to various patients,  including very old patients, the demented, or even patients in persistent vegetative states, through on-site judgment. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need  for Japan to establish and enact a basic act for patient rights. The act should include: respect for a patient's right to self-determination; the right to refuse unwanted treatment; the right to prepare legally binding advance directives; the  right to decline to prepare such directives; and access to nationally insured healthcare. It should enable those concerned with patient care involving DT to seek ethical advice from ethics committees. Furthermore, it should state that healthcare professionals involved in the discontinuation of life support in a proper manner are immune to any legal action and that they have the right to conscientiously object to LVAD deactivation.";;Asai A, Masaki S, Okita T, Enzo A, Kadooka Y;;eng;['Advance Directives', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Culture', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Health Services Accessibility/*ethics', 'Heart Failure/surgery/*therapy', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Assist Devices/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Personhood', 'Policy', '*Quality of Life', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Technology/*ethics', 'Value of Life'];['*Advance care planning', '*Advance directives', '*Culture', '*Destination therapy', '*Japan', '*LVAD deactivation', '*Super-aging society'];;;10.1186/s12910-018-0251-z

A recent issue of FT for patients who are blind has arisen. Some bioethicists recommend not excluding a patient who is  blind, as this may amount to discrimination. From an ethical standpoint, FT for those with blindness is appropriate in selected candidates. This article seeks to add to the clinical evidence supporting FT for those with blindness by detailing  a complementary psychosocial perspective. Currently, there is little relevant research about the subjectivity of the blind. This is critical since the arguments against FT for the blind refer to their inability to see their face and to view the reaction of others to their disfigured faces. We begin with a brief look at examples of FT involving blindness and associated arguments. The next part is a multidisciplinary investigation of the experiences of the blind. These  are gleaned from a close reading of the literature and drawing inferences, as direct studies are rare. The discussion analyses identity themes of the blind in  relation to their faces: as they experience it; the face they wish to show to the world; and how others perceive and react to their face in a saturated environment of imagery and visual communication.

We determined KAS's impact on pediatric kidney recipients by examining delayed graft function (DGF) rates from 2010 to 2016. A propensity score-matched pediatric recipients pre- and post-KAS. A semiparametric decomposition analysis estimated the contributions of KAS-related changes in donor characteristics and dialysis time on DGF rate. The unadjusted odds of DGF were 69% higher post-KAS for young (<10 years at listing) recipients (N = 1153, P = .02) but were not significantly  increased for older pediatric (10-17 years at listing) recipients (N = 2624, P =  .48). Post-KAS, young recipients received significantly fewer pediatric (<18 years) donor kidneys (21% vs 32%, P < .01) and had longer median pretransplant dialysis time (603 vs 435 days, P < .01). After propensity score matching, post-KAS status increased the odds of DGF in young recipients 71% (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.46). In decomposition analysis, 24% of the higher DGF rate post-KAS was attributable to donor characteristics and 19% to increased recipient dialysis time. In a confirmatory survival analysis, DGF was associated with a 2.2 times higher risk of graft failure (aHR2.28, 95% CI 1.46-3.54).

1643;29446874;Article;2018;American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons;;Transplant recipients are vulnerable to coverage denial under Medicare Part D.;;Transplant immunosuppressants are often used off-label because of insufficient randomized prospective trial data to achieve organ-specific US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Transplant recipients who rely on Medicare Part D  for immunosuppressant drug coverage are vulnerable to coverage denial for off-label prescriptions, unless use is supported by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)-approved compendia. An integrated dataset including national transplant registry data and 3 years of dispensed pharmacy records was used to identify the prevalence of immunosuppression use that is both off-label and not supported by CMS-approved compendia. Numbers of potentially vulnerable transplant recipients were identified. Off-label and off-compendia immunosuppression regimens are frequently prescribed (3-year mean: lung 66.5%, intestine 34.2%, pancreas 33.4%, heart 21.8%, liver 16.5%, kidney 0%). The annual retail cost of these at-risk medications exceeds $30 million. This population-based study of transplant immunosuppressants vulnerable to claim denials under Medicare Part D coverage demonstrates a substantial gap between clinical practice, current FDA approval processes, and policy mandates for pharmaceutical coverage. This coverage barrier reduces access to life-saving medications for patients without alternative resources and may increase the risk  of graft loss and death from medication nonadherence.;;Potter LM, Maldonado AQ, Lentine KL, Schnitzler MA, Zhang Z, Hess GP, Garrity E, Kasiske BL, Axelrod DA;;eng;['Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S.', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', '*Medicare Part D', '*Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration'];['*ethics and public policy', '*immunosuppressant', '*immunosuppression/immune modulation', '*insurance', '*insurance - public', '*law/legislation', '*off-label drug use'];;;10.1111/ajt.14703

Cases may be divided into three types: both twins suffer from lethal abnormalities, only one twin has a lethal abnormality, or neither twin does. In the first kind of case, there is no reason to separate,  since both twins will die regardless of treatment. In the third kind of case, I argue that separation at an early age is unethical because the twins are likely to achieve an irreplaceably good quality of life-the goods of conjoinment-that separation takes away. Evaluation of this possibility requires maturation past early childhood. Regarding the second type, I point out that with conceivable but unrecorded exceptions, these cases will consistently involve sacrifice separation. I present an argument that sacrifice separation is unethical, but in  some cases a moral dilemma may exist in which separation and refraining from separation are both unethical. Perhaps in such cases a decision can be made on non-moral grounds; however, the possibility of such a decision serves not to mitigate but to underscore the fact that the separation is unethical. My conclusion, which applies to all three types of cases, is that it is unethical to separate conjoined twins before their developing personalities give some reliable indication as to whether they desire separation and whether they will achieve those goods of conjoinment.";;Kallberg L;;eng;['Clinical Decision-Making', '*Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Morals', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Quality of Life', 'Twins, Conjoined/*surgery'];['*Autonomy', '*Conjoined twins', '*Moral dilemmas', '*Necessity (legal doctrine)', '*Organ transplantation', '*Quality of life', '*Self-defense'];;;10.1007/s11017-018-9435-2

Paired exchanges have facilitated thousands of kidney transplants and enable transplantation when the donor and recipient are incompatible. However, frequently willing and otherwise healthy donors have contraindications to the donation of the organ that their recipient needs. Trans-organ paired exchanges would enable a donor associated with a kidney recipient to donate a lobe of liver and a donor associated with a liver recipient to donate a kidney.

1647;29433496;Article;2018;BMC medical ethics;;Benefit in liver transplantation: a survey among medical staff, patients, medical students and non-medical university staff and students.;;BACKGROUND: The allocation of any scarce health care resource, especially a lifesaving resource, can create profound ethical and legal challenges. Liver transplant allocation currently is based upon urgency, a sickest-first approach,  and does not utilize capacity to benefit. While urgency can be described reasonably well with the MELD system, benefit encompasses multiple dimensions of  patients' well-being. Currently, the balance between both principles is ill-defined. METHODS: This survey with 502 participants examines how urgency and  benefit are weighted by different stakeholders (medical staff, patients on the liver transplant list or already transplanted, medical students and non-medical university staff and students). RESULTS: Liver transplant patients favored the sickest-first allocation, although all other groups tended to favor benefit. Criteria of a successful transplantation were a minimum survival of at least 1 year and recovery of functional status to being ambulatory and capable of all self-care (ECOG 2). An individual delisting decision was accepted when the 1-year survival probability would fall below 50%. Benefit was found to be a critical variable that may also trigger the willingness to donate organs.

Unlike the kidneys or the liver, the uterus is not specifically a  vital organ. Given the non-lifesaving nature of this procedure, questions have been raised about its feasibility. The ethical dilemma revolves around whether it is worth placing two lives at risk related to surgery and immunosuppression, amongst others, to enable a woman with absolute uterine factor infertility to experience the presence of an organ enabling childbirth. In the year 2000, the first uterine transplantation, albeit unsuccessful, was performed in Saudi Arabia from where it has spread to the rest of the world including Sweden, the United States and now recently India.

A specific objective was to determine families' perceptions of how their experiences influenced donation decision-making. METHODS: Retrospective, qualitative interviews were undertaken with 43 participants of 31 donor families  to generate rich, informative data. Participant recruitment was via 10 National Health Service Trusts, representative of five regional organ donation services in the UK. Twelve families agreed to DBD, 18 agreed to DCD, 1 unknown. Participants' responses were contextualised using a temporal framework of 'The Past', which represented families' prior knowledge, experience, attitudes, beliefs, and intentions toward organ donation; 'The Present', which incorporated the moment in time when families experienced the potential for donation; and 'The Future', which corresponded to expectations and outcomes arising from the donation decision. RESULTS: Temporally interwoven experiences appeared to influence families' decisions to donate the organs of their deceased relative for transplantation.

1653;29407326;Article;2018;Transplantation proceedings;;Quantitative Survey of Laypersons' Attitudes Toward Organ Transplantation in Japan.;;BACKGROUND: In comparison with foreign countries, living-organ transplantations (LOT) have been performed more frequently than dead organ transplants, including  brain-dead organ transplantation (BOT) in Japan. This situation has given rise to organ transplantation tourism. Therefore, we clarify laypersons' preferences regarding organ transplantation that are producing the current situation in Japan, to suggest a possible framework for further efforts. METHODS: Voluntary completion of a quantitative and anonymous survey was promoted online (a sample size of 1030). The questionnaire had two types of variables concerning demographic characteristics and organ transplantation-related issues. RESULTS: LOT was favored over BOT. However, for willingness to donate to family members, the participants showed a significantly more positive attitude toward brain-dead  organ donors (BODs) than living organ donors (LODs). In the evaluation of each transplantation technology, BOT and LOT were positioned in the middle, between transplantation that does not depend on others and the utilization of animal organs. CONCLUSIONS: Although LOT was favored over BOT, for participants hypothesized to be in a position to donate and receive organs, BODs received a conversely better reputation than LODs. Our survey and discussion suggest that the present conditions of organ transplantation in Japan might be because there is a lack of deliberation on transplantation tourism and LOT. Therefore, more surveys concerning LOT cases and the implications of avoidance of organs from brain-dead bodies, coupled with more discussions based on these surveys, are necessary to formulate a Japanese transplantation policy for the future.;;Okita T, Hsu E, Aizawa K, Nakada H, Toya W, Matsui K;;eng;['Adult', 'Attitude to Death', '*Attitude to Health', 'Brain Death', 'Family/psychology', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2017.11.011

There are increasing number of cases reported in the literature, as the number of institutions utilizing this strategy is growing. Herein, we review the current literature of combined thoracic and liver transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: A larger number of combined heart or lung and liver transplants (CHLT and CLLT) are being performed. A recent literature search showed approximately 231 CHLT and 89 CLLT and being described. One-year patient survival ranged from 71 to 80% for CLLT and 80-93% for CHLT, respectively. Indications for combined transplant and disease-specific outcomes are still being evaluated. Additionally, salvage modalities such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ex-vivo lung perfusion are also being described. SUMMARY: Combined thoracic and liver transplant continues to be a viable treatment option  for patients with end-stage disease that would likely not survive single transplant alone. Salvage modalities, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ex-vivo lung perfusion, may help in extending candidacy for this combined transplant. Outcomes, to date, are similar to results observed for solitary thoracic organ recipients, justifying CHLT and CLLT as a viable option for these  patients.

Parents, risk, and living kidney donation: Revisiting the arguments for and against parental living donation of kidneys.;;Historically, living kidney donation has been justified in part by our belief that living donors face minimal risks of subsequent disease. Recent research has  brought that presumption into question, particularly for younger donors including parents. In light of this finding, we re-examine many of the traditional arguments both for and against the practice of parental living kidney donation. We then propose an alternative framework in which the burden of having a child with end-stage kidney disease can be considered as an illness experienced by the  potential donor parent. We believe this allows a more straightforward, as well as more accurate, assessment of the risks and benefits of donation for the potential parental donor. This assessment might then be used to best inform the decision whether or not to proceed with kidney donation using a shared decision-making model, while reflecting the appropriate ethical roles of both the potential donor and the transplantation program.;;Freeman MA, Wightman AG;;eng;['Adult', 'Child', 'Decision Making', 'Donor Selection/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', '*Parents', 'Risk'];;;;10.1111/petr.13153

The argument presented in this paper demonstrates that there are no morally relevant dissimilarities between living kidney donation and living kidney selling for effective altruistic reasons. Thus, since the former is allowed, the  latter ought to be allowed as well. And, there are important moral differences between living kidney selling for effective altruistic reasons and other reasons  for kidney vending (e.g., for personal financial gain), such that standard objections against markets in human kidneys do not attach to those markets designed around principles of effective altruism. The reasonable conclusion to draw from this is that eligible effective altruist kidney donors ought to be allowed to sell (one of) their kidneys to others in need, if they so desire. Because of this, law and policy ought to be changed to allow for this exceptional case: current laws that ban kidney selling for everyone, irrespective of their reason for selling, are unjustified.;;Tonkens R;;eng;['*Altruism', 'Charities', '*Commerce', 'Ethical Analysis', 'Gift Giving', 'Humans', '*Kidney', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Morals', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['*effective altruism', '*group soft paternalism', '*incomplete commodification', '*living kidney donation', '*living kidney selling', '*seller regret'];;;10.1111/bioe.12427

We have thus far failed to translate fully our limited understanding of why families refuse permission into successful strategies targeting consent in the setting of deceased organ donation, primarily because our interventions fail  to target underlying cognitive obstacles. Novel interventions to overcome these hurdles, incorporating an understanding of cognitive psychology and behavioral change therapy, may be beneficial. One potential intervention is to use the concept of nudge theory, where decision-making is influenced by encouraging positive reinforcement and indirect suggestion. Purposefully nudging families to  given consent for organ donation by understanding, and then overcoming, their inherent cognitive biases is novel but also controversial.

Liver failure accelerates frailty, resulting in skeletal muscle atrophy, functional decline and an associated risk of liver transplant waiting list mortality. However, there is limited research investigating the impact of exercise on patient outcomes pre and post liver transplantation. The waitlist period for patients listed for liver transplantation provides a unique opportunity to provide and assess interventions such as prehabilitation. METHODS  AND ANALYSIS: This study is a phase I observational study evaluating the feasibility of conducting a randomised control trial (RCT) investigating the use  of a home-based exercise programme (HBEP) in the management of patients awaiting  liver transplantation. Twenty eligible patients will be randomly selected from the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Birmingham liver transplant waiting list. Participants will be provided with an individually tailored 12-week HBEP, including step targets and resistance exercises. Activity trackers and patient diaries will be provided to support data collection. For the initial 6 weeks, telephone support will be given to discuss compliance with the study intervention, achievement of weekly targets, and to address any queries or concerns regarding the intervention. During weeks 6-12, participants will continue the intervention without telephone support to evaluate longer term adherence to the study intervention. On completing the intervention, all participants will be invited to engage in a focus group to discuss their experiences and the feasibility of an RCT. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol is approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West - Greater Manchester East and Health Research Authority (REC reference: 17/NW/0120). Recruitment into the study started in April 2017 and ended in July 2017. Follow-up of participants is ongoing and due to finish by the end of 2017.

1662;29346260;Article;2018;Transplantation;;Race, Risk, and Willingness of End-Stage Renal Disease Patients Without Hepatitis C Virus to Accept an HCV-Infected Kidney Transplant.;;"BACKGROUND: Despite effective antiviral treatment, hundreds of kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are discarded annually. Little is known about the determinants of willingness to accept HCV-infected kidneys among  HCV-negative patients. METHODS: At 2 centers, 189 patients undergoing initial or  reevaluation for transplant made 12 hypothetical decisions about accepting HCV-infected kidneys in which we systematically varied expected HCV cure rate, allograft quality, and wait time for an uninfected kidney. RESULTS: Only 29% of the participants would accept an HCV-infected kidney under all scenarios, whereas 53% accepted some offers and rejected others, and 18% rejected all HCV-infected kidneys. Higher cure rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33-5.24 for 95% vs 75% probability of HCV cure), younger donor (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.91-2.88 for a 20-year-old vs a 60-year-old hypertensive donor), and longer  wait for an uninfected kidney (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.22-1.67 for 5 years vs 2 years) were associated with greater willingness to accept an HCV-infected kidney. Black race modified the effect of HCV cure rate, such that willingness to accept  a kidney increased less for blacks versus whites as the cure rate improved. Patients older than 60 years and prior kidney recipients showed greater willingness to accept an HCV-infected organ. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients will consider an HCV-infected kidney in some situations. Future trials using HCV-infected kidneys may enhance enrollment by targeting older patients and prior transplant recipients, but centers should anticipate that black patients' acceptance of HCV-infected kidneys will be reduced compared with white patients.";;McCauley M, Mussell A, Goldberg D, Sawinski D, Molina RN, Tomlin R, Doshi SD, Abt P, Bloom R, Blumberg E, Kulkarni S, Esnaola G, Shults J, Thiessen C, Reese PP;;eng;['Adult', 'African Americans/*psychology', '*Donor Selection', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice/ethnology', '*Hepatitis C', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/ethnology/psychology/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*ethnology/psychology', 'Risk', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000002099

The aim of the study was to evaluate the image quality, overall evaluability, and effective radiation dose (ED) of cCTA with prospective electrocardiographic (ECG) triggering plus MCA as compared with standard protocol with retrospective ECG triggering in patients with HR>/=65 bpm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients (67+/-10 y) scheduled for cCTA with 65<HR<80 bpm were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were assigned  to 2 groups undergoing prospective (group 1) or retrospective (group 2) triggered cCTA. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and a written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Image noise, signal to noise ratio, contrast to noise ratio, Likert image quality score (score 1, nondiagnostic; score 2, adequate; score 3, good; score 4, excellent), overall image evaluability, and ED were measured and compared between the 2 groups. Both  vessel-based and patient-based analyses were evaluated. Student test or Wilcoxon  test were used to evaluate differences of continuous variables, whereas the chi test was used to study differences with regard to categorical data. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: cCTA was successfully performed in all patients. In a segment-based model, group 1 compared with group  2 showed a lower rate of overall artifacts (67% vs. 83%; P<0.001) and motion artifacts (49% vs. 66%; P<0.001), resulting in a better Likert image quality score (2.83+/-1.03 vs. 2.37+/-1.02; P<0.01) and overall evaluability (85% vs. 75%; P<0.01). Group 1 showed a lower ED as compared with group 2 (3.1+/-1.9 vs. 11.9+/-3.3 mSv; P<0.01).

1664;29332204;Article;2018;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;Supplementing living kidney transplantees' medical records with donor- and recipient-narratives.;;Norway provides total social welfare coverage for organ transplantations, including free immunosuppressive medication and prepaid life-long follow up for both recipients and donors. Despite these benefits the proportion of living kidney donors (LKD) has in recent years declined from around 40% (2011) of all kidney transplantations to 24% (2016). This study suggests harnessing patient- and donor-narratives as a tool for addressing the current fall in donation rates. The hospital records of 18 recipient/donor dyads were compared with patient and donor accounts elicited in semi-structured interviews. Narratives afford a pertinent supplement to the primarily biomedical and technical information stored in medical records. Even in condensed form, the messages embedded in narratives contribute to a 'thicker' understanding of the complexity of living kidney donation (LKD)-decisions. Narratives represent a source of education for referring-nephrologists wishing to deepen their evaluation skills and avoid making decisions based on insufficient insight into patients' and potential donors' values and life-situation. Recipients' and donors' unedited accounts of their motivations, worries, doubts and expectations afford a revealing and edifying supplement to the primarily biomedical and technical information stored  in medical records. In narratives, the predicaments and dilemmas surrounding LKD  become visible and debatable and can serve as support for future donors, recipients and the nephrologists responsible for evaluation-conclusions. Generating narratives raises a number of practical, epistemic and normative challenges.;;Hambro Alnaes A;;eng;['Family/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', '*Medical Records', '*Narration', 'Norway', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk Factors'];['Bioethics', 'Deterrents', 'Donors', 'Medical records', 'Narratives', 'Preemptive kidney transplantation'];;2007/2/0300/EkstraStiftelsen Helse og Rehabilitering;10.1007/s11019-017-9822-x

Volatility of the 5-tier ratings assessing quality of transplant centers in the United States.;;Outcomes of patients receiving solid organ transplants in the United States are systematically aggregated into bi-annual Program-Specific Reports (PSRs) detailing risk-adjusted survival by transplant center. Recently, the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) issued 5-tier ratings evaluating centers based on risk-adjusted 1-year graft survival. Our primary aim was to examine the  reliability of 5-tier ratings over time. Using 10 consecutive PSRs for adult kidney transplant centers from June 2012 to December 2016 (n = 208), we applied 5-tier ratings to center outcomes and evaluated ratings over time. From the baseline period (June 2012), 47% of centers had at least a 1-unit tier change within 6 months, 66% by 1 year, and 94% by 3 years. Similarly, 46% of centers had at least a 2-unit tier change by 3 years. In comparison, 15% of centers had a change in the traditional 3-tier rating at 3 years. The 5-tier ratings at 4 years had minimal association with baseline rating (Kappa 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.002 to 0.158). Centers had a median of 3 different 5-tier ratings over the period (q1 = 2, q3 = 4). Findings were consistent for center volume, transplant rate, and baseline 5-tier rating. Cumulatively, results suggest that 5-tier ratings are highly volatile, limiting their utility for informing potential stakeholders, particularly transplant candidates given expected waiting times between wait listing and transplantation.;;Schold JD, Andreoni KA, Chandraker AK, Gaston RS, Locke JE, Mathur AK, Pruett TL, Rana A, Ratner LE, Buccini LD;;eng;['Adult', 'Health Facilities/*standards', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*standards', 'United States'];['*ethics and public policy', '*graft survival', '*health services and outcomes research', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*organ transplantation in general', '*patient education', '*statistics'];;;10.1111/ajt.14659

Major breakthroughs in stem cell research have not yet enjoyed clinical success-all stem cell therapies bar hematopoietic stem cell transplantations remain experimental. With the increased  risk of organ failure and neurodegenerative disease associated with our ability to push the boundaries of life expectancy comes an increased pressure to pioneer  novel stem cell-based therapeutic approaches. We conclude that the failure of such therapies to achieve clinical translation stems from the polarising effect of the ethical debate around their use. The intractability of the ethical debate  is double edged: legislators not only have placed tighter restrictions on certain stem cell therapies, but do so in favour of less controversial cells which will have worse outcomes for patients. It is by considering this relationship between  the politics, ethics and science of stem cells that the reasons for the currently limited clinical significance of stem cell therapies be realised.;;Poulos J;;eng;['Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*ethics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/therapy', 'Stem Cell Research/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*ethics', 'Stem Cells'];['*DCM', '*Durisotto vs Italy', '*MSC', '*STAP', '*Stem cell ethics', '*Stem cell politics', '*Stem cell regulation', '*X-Cell Centre', '*hESC', '*iPSC'];;;10.1186/s13287-017-0735-7

Educational health campaigns can effectively inform the general public and institute behavioral modifications. A brief educational introduction to facial transplantation may positively influence the public's position on facial donation. METHODS: The authors anonymously surveyed 300 participants, gathering basic demographic information, donor registration status, awareness of facial transplantation, and willingness to donate solid organs and facial allografts. Two-hundred of these participants were presented an educational video and subsequently resurveyed on facial donation. Factorial parametric analyses were performed to compare exposure responses before and after watching video exposure. RESULTS: Among participants completing the survey alone  (control group), 49 percent were registered donors, 78 percent reported willingness to donate solid organs, and 52 percent reported willingness to donate facial allograft. Of participants who watched the video (video group) 52 percent  were registered; 69 and 51 percent were willing to donate solid organs and face,  respectively. Following educational intervention, 69 percent of participants in the video group reported willingness to donate facial tissue, an 18 percent increase (p < 0.05), that equated to those willing to donate solid organs. The greatest increase was observed among younger participants (23 percent); women (22 percent); Jewish (22 percent), Catholic (22 percent), and black/African American  (25 percent) participants; and respondents holding a higher degree. No significant differences according to gender or ethnicity were observed.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 19 622 lung transplant candidates waitlisted between 2006 and 2015. We used multivariable adjusted competing risk survival models to examine the relationship between local lung availability and waitlist outcomes. The primary outcome was a composite of death and removal from the waitlist for clinical deterioration. Waitlist candidates in the lowest quartile of local lung availability had an 84% increased risk of death or removal compared with candidates in the highest (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]: 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-2.24, P < .001). The transplantation rate was 57%  lower in the lowest quartile compared with the highest (SHR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.39-0.47). The adjusted death or removal rate decreased by 11% with a 50% increase in local lung availability (SHR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85-0.93, P < .001) and  the adjusted transplantation rate increased by 19% (SHR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.17-1.22, P < .001).

The purpose of this article is to critically examine the conditions under which such prioritization is morally justified, by challenging arguments put forth by Walter Glannon and Daniel Brudney. There are serious theoretical and practical problems with these views, which have to do with the nature and scope of the (putative) moral duty not to contribute to the competition for scarce transplantable livers, and the difficulty in determining whether people are responsible for their weakness or even wickedness of character.

Yet, when symptoms progress faster than the patient's suitability for transplant can be evaluated, this device may be implanted as a ""bridge-to-decision"" while a transplant evaluation is completed. Therein lies the potential for history to repeat itself.

In an ethics-approved retrospective study, 144 liver donor candidates with magnetic  resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 6-echo Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 2013 and 2015 were included. A subset of 32 candidates underwent liver biopsy. Hepatic fat percentage was determined using MR-PDFF and histopathology-determined fat fraction as the reference standard. A receiver operating characteristic analysis with positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity was performed to discriminate between clinically significant steatosis (>/=10%) or not (<10%) at MRS-PDFF and MRI-PDFF thresholds of 5% and 10%. Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analyses between MRS-PDFF and MRI-PDFF were performed for intraindividual comparison of hepatic steatosis estimation. There was significant association between MRS-PDFF and MRI-PDFF with HP-FP. High NPV of 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-99%) and 100% (95% CI, 76%-100%) as well as an area under the curve of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79-1.0) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84-1.0) were obtained with a cutoff threshold of 5% MRI-PDFF and MRS-PDFF, respectively, to exclude clinically significant steatosis (>/=10%). Intraindividual comparison between MRS-PDFF and MRI-PDFF showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83. Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of 1% with 95% limits of agreement between -1% and 3%. MR-PDFF estimate of negligible hepatic fat percentage (<5%) has sufficient NPV for excluding clinically significant hepatic steatosis (>/=10%) in living liver donor candidates obviating the need for liver biopsy.

By restoring the circulation in the deceased donor, even if the cerebral circulation is excluded, the Papworth technique challenges the acceptability of death determination in DCD. RECENT FINDINGS: This study uses as its exemplar case the Papworth DCD heart technique to review and make wider comment about death determination in DCD. We seek to answer three challenges to ethical propriety raised by the Papworth technique: death determination using the permanence standard (common to all DCD practice); restoration of heart contractility and circulation in the body; and active prevention of the restoration of brain circulation by use of a cross-clamp to isolate the cerebral  circulation. SUMMARY: The Papworth technique for heart DCD does not compromise the permanence standard for declaring death and therefore respects the dead donor rule in the UK, but perhaps elsewhere the law would need to change to refer to the cessation of circulation in the brain.";;McGee A, Gardiner D, Murphy P;;eng;['*Blood Circulation', '*Death', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Organ Preservation/*methods', 'Perfusion', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000478

In 2016, the Declaration of Istanbul Custodian Group convened an international, multidisciplinary workshop in Madrid, Spain, to address these challenges and provide recommendations for the management of these patients, which are presented in this paper. The core recommendations are grounded in the belief that principles of transparency, traceability, and continuity of care applied to patients who receive an organ domestically should also apply to patients who receive an organ abroad. Governments and professionals are urged to ensure that,  upon return, patients are promptly referred to a transplant center for evaluation and care, not cover the costs of transplants resulting from organ or human trafficking, register standardized information at official registries on patients who travel for transplantation, promote international exchange of data for traceability, and develop a framework for the notification of identified or suspected cases of transnational transplant-related crimes by health professionals to law enforcement agencies.;;Dominguez-Gil B, Danovitch G, Martin DE, Lopez-Fraga M, Van Assche K, Morris ML, Lavee J, Erlich G, Fadhil R, Busic M, Rankin G, Al-Rukhaimi M, O'Connell P, Chin J, Norman T, Massari P, Kamel R, Delmonico FL;;eng;['*Continuity of Patient Care', 'Humans', '*Medical Tourism', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000001963

Matnat Chaim is a Jewish orthodox organization active in Israel since 2009. This is a voluntary organization with aims to shorten and eliminate the waiting list for kidneys. Since the beginning of its activity, it has said to play a key role in 379 kidney transplantations. In 2015, out of 174 live donor kidney transplantations that took place in Israel, Matnat Chaim had a  key role in 88 of them (50.6%). We found some ethical issues concerning the organization's activity. The donor can restrict his or her donation to specific characteristics of recipient which can result in organs transplanted in a homogeneous group of the population. Another issue is the question of whether nudging people to kidney donation takes place and whether it is valid to do so. We found that Matnat Chaim does a great deal for promotion and intermediation of  kidney donations in Israel. This form of promotion can be implemented by other organizations and countries.;;Rabinowich A, Jotkowitz A;;eng;['*Altruism', '*Faith-Based Organizations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Jews/psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/epidemiology/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Living Donors/*ethics/supply & distribution', 'Motivation', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Kidney transplantation', 'Motivating living kidney donation', 'Religious-based non-government organization'];;;10.1007/s10943-017-0488-8

Liver transplant candidates with HCC compete for the same deceased donor organs as those without HCC. These scarce organs must be allocated fairly and justly to those who will benefit most. Unlike most other cancers, HCC  is often diagnosed noninvasively by imaging without biopsy confirmation. Therefore, radiologists play an important role in diagnosing definite HCC (i.e.,  LR-5 category) that counts toward staging and determination of liver transplant eligibility. This review explains the conversion of LI-RADS observation categories to organ procurement and transplantation network classes, illustrates  the radiologic T-staging systems, reviews selection criteria for liver transplant eligibility, and discusses prioritization of liver transplant candidates with HCC. In addition, this review summarizes imaging requirements, including contrast agents accepted, minimum specifications for dynamic CT or MRI of the liver, and modalities accepted for assessment of extrahepatic spread or metastatic disease in liver transplant candidates with HCC.;;Tang A, Fowler KJ, Chernyak V, Chapman WC, Sirlin CB;;eng;['*Algorithms', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/pathology/*surgery', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Selection/*ethics'];['*Eligibility', '*Hepatocellular carcinoma', '*Prioritization', '*Review article', '*Staging', '*Transplantation'];;26993/Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Sante (CA)/International;10.1007/s00261-017-1210-8
1683;28551773;Article;2018;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;Should physicians tell the truth without taking social complications into account? A striking case.;;The principle of respect for autonomy requires informing patients adequately and  appropriately about diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses. However, some clinical  cases may cause ethical dilemmas regarding telling the truth. Under the existence especially of certain cultural, social, and religious circumstances, disclosing all the relevant information to all pertinent parties might create harmful effects. Even though the virtue of telling the truth is unquestionable, sometimes de facto conditions compel physicians to act paternalistically to protect the patient/patients from imminent dangers. This article, which aims to study the issue of whether a physician should always tell the truth, analyzes an interesting case that represents the detection of misattributed paternity during  pre-transplant tests for a kidney transplant from the son to the father in Turkey, where social, cultural, and religious factors have considerable impact on marital infidelity. After analyzing the concept of telling the truth and its relationship with paternalism and two major ethical theories, consequentialism and deontology, it is concluded that the value of the integrity of life and survival overrides the value of telling the truth. For this reason, in the case of a high possibility of severe and imminent threats, withholding some information is ethically justifiable.;;Avci E;;eng;['Adult', 'Extramarital Relations/*ethnology', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Paternity', 'Physicians/*ethics', 'Truth Disclosure/*ethics', 'Turkey'];['Consequentialism', 'Deontology', 'Paternalism', 'Social complications', 'Telling the truth'];;;10.1007/s11019-017-9779-9
1684;28527046;Article;2018;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;On harm thresholds and living organ donation: must the living donor benefit, on balance, from his donation?;;For the majority of scholars concerned with the ethics of living organ donation,  inflicting moderate harms on competent volunteers in order to save the lives or increase the life chances of others is held to be justifiable provided certain conditions are met. These conditions tend to include one, or more commonly, some  combination of the following: (1) The living donor provides valid consent to donation. (2) Living donation produces an overall positive balance of harm-benefit for donors and recipients which cannot be obtained in a less harmful manner. (3) Donation is not liable to cause significant and long-term morbidity to, or the death of, the donor. This paper critically examines the suggestion that these criteria are not sufficient to offer a general account of justified living organ donation in the context of competent volunteers and that key to justified living organ donation is that donors receive sufficient benefits from their donation that these outweigh the harms they suffer. However, although this  view-termed here 'The Donor Benefit Standard'-directs welcome attention to the many and complex motives which may underlie living organ donation, this paper ultimately concludes that given the threats this position poses to individual autonomy and the lives of those in need of organ transplants 'The Donor Benefit Standard' should ultimately be rejected.;;Williams NJ;;eng;['Altruism', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Autonomy', 'Beneficence', 'Harm', 'Living organ donation', 'Transplantation ethics'];;Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom;10.1007/s11019-017-9778-x

Perhaps surprisingly, exploitation arguments  against organ markets have been widely rejected in the philosophical literature on the subject. It is often argued that concerns about exploitation should be addressed by increasing the price paid to organ sellers, not by banning the trade outright. I argue that this analysis rests on a particular conception of exploitation (which I refer to as 'fair benefits' exploitation), and outline two  additional ways that the charge of exploitation can be understood (which I discuss in terms of 'fair process' exploitation and complicity in injustice). I argue that while increasing payments to organ sellers may mitigate or eliminate fair benefits exploitation, such measures will not necessarily address fair process exploitation or complicity in injustice. I further argue that each of these three forms of wrongdoing is relevant to the ethics of paid living organ donation, as well as the design of public policy more generally.;;Koplin JJ;;eng;['Commerce/*ethics', '*Commodification', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Commodification', 'Exploitation', 'Organ sales', 'Organ transplantation', 'Structural injustice'];;;10.1007/s10728-017-0340-z

A serious interest in VCA developed in the late twentieth century following advances in immunosuppression which had led to significant improvements in short and medium-term survival among SOT recipients.

China, in particular, faces an extraordinary gap between the number of organs donated by deceased donors and the number of people seeking one or more transplants. China might look to Western countries with higher donation rates to determine how best to introduce Western practices into the Chinese system. In attempting to increase its organ donation rate, China must not only ensure that its organ donation system reflects different Chinese cultural values, but also that it avoids the ethical problems of the United States and of other Western systems. This article examines four such problems. They concern the family, obtaining permission for organ donation,  the definition and diagnosis of ""brain death,"" and trust.

To the frustration of organ procurement teams, families do not always authorize organ donation. As a result, efforts to increase the number of organs available for transplantation often seek to limit the authority of families to refuse organ retrieval. For example, in some locales if a deceased family member has satisfied the legal conditions for first-person prior assent, a much looser and easier standard to satisfy than informed consent, organ retrieval may proceed despite the family's objections. Some countries have  replaced voluntary consent to organ donation with forms of organ conscription. Often referred to under the misnomer ""presumed consent,"" such policies legalize the harvesting of organs at death, unless individuals exercise official options to opt out. As this article explores, however, there are good grounds for affirming the authority of the family to consent to or to deny organ donation on  behalf of recently deceased family members, as well as to reject first-person assent and ""presumed consent"" policies of organ procurement. Insofar as individuals have failed clearly and competently to provide informed consent to organ donation, moral authorization for the use of the person and his body ought  to be grounded on the foundational authority of the family, rather than the state's supposed interests in obtaining organs for transplantation.";;Cherry MJ;;eng;['Decision Making', 'Family/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/psychology', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Philosophy, Medical', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];['*family-based decision making', '*first-person assent', '*organ donation', '*presumed consent'];;;10.1093/jmp/jhz017

The gift-of-life metaphor has begun to dominate public discussion and education about organ donation. However, ethical and legal problems remain concerning this ""gift-of-life"" discourse: In what sense are donated organs a ""gift-of-life""? What constitutes the ultimate worth of such a gift? On whose authority should organs as a ""gift-of-life"" be donated? There are no universal answers to these questions; instead, responses must be compatible with local cultural values. This paper argues that from a Confucian point of view, organs should be viewed as a gift from the donor's family, and that final dispositional authority should also rest with the donor's  family. The worth of such a ""gift"" rests on the virtue of ren, the origin of which is family love.

Additional issues raised by death by donation include breach of the ""dead-donor rule""; what would constitute informed  consent to it; and what impact its acceptance would have on important foundational societal values, especially respect for human dignity and human life. The second question is ""Why might some people who agree with euthanasia and even organ donation after death by euthanasia find death by donation ethically unacceptable?""

Organ donation as an act of love requires it to be an act of freedom that honors  the integrity of the human person who is in the process of dying. However, the process of organ donation, by necessity, inserts a third party of interest whose  primary aim is to assist someone other than the dying person. Caregivers can become ""organ focused"" instead of ""patient focused."" The procurement of organs potentially results in the commodification of the potential organ donor. Furthermore, death is not a momentary event but rather an ontological change in the person where the union of body and soul becomes divided. This Catholic understanding of death is important to assess the impact of organ donation on the process of dying. Family members of organ donors often have traumatic memories associated with the organ donation process, potentially overshadowing the ars moriendi-the art of dying. Summary: While organ donation is an act of love, the donation process can be distraction from the care of the dying patient, who may be treated differently than other dying patients who are not organ donors.

At the time of death, families, friends or others assume responsibility as substitute decision-makers (SDMs) to consent to organ donation. Despite their central role in this process, little is known about what barriers,  enablers and beliefs influence decision-making among SDMs. This study aims to explore the experiences and perspectives of SDMs involved in making decisions around the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, end-of-life care and deceased organ donation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SDMs of 60 patients admitted to intensive care units will be enrolled for this study. Ten hospitals across five provinces in Canada in a prospective multicentre qualitative cohort study. We will conduct  semistructured telephone interviews in English or French with SDMs between 6 and  8 weeks after the patient's death. Our sampling frame will stratify SDMs into three groups: SDMs who were not approached for organ donation; SDMs who were approached and consented to donate and SDMs who were approached but did not consent to donate. We will use two complementary theoretical frameworks-the Common-Sense Self-Regulation Model and the Theoretical Domains Framework- to inform our interview guide. Interview data will be analysed using deductive directed content analysis and inductive thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal Research Ethics Board. The findings from this study will help identify key factors affecting substitute decision-making in deceased organ  donation, reasons for non-consent and barriers to achieve congruency between SDM  and patient wishes.

Canadian liver and kidney transplantation campaigns posted to GoFundMe between May 30 & 31 2018 were identified and after exclusion, 258 kidney and 171 liver campaigns were included in study. These campaigns were coded for: worthiness of the campaign recipient, requested financial and non-monetary contributions, how monetary donations would be spent,  and comments on the Canadian health system, among others. Results suggest Canadian organ donors, transplant candidates, recipients, and their families and  caregivers experience significant financial difficulties not addressed by the public health system. Living and medication costs, transportation and relocation  expenses, and income loss were the expenses most commonly highlighted by campaigners. Liver campaigns raised nearly half their goal while kidney campaigns received 11.5% of their requested amount.

Variants of the ApoL1 gene associated with increased risk are primarily found in people with  West African ancestry. Given uncertainty about clinical implications of ApoL1 test results for living kidney donors and recipients and the lack of uniform guidelines for ApoL1 testing, transplant centers across the United States vary in ApoL1 testing practices. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) What approach do transplant centers take to determine whether prospective donors are of West African ancestry? (2)How do transplant centers engage potential donors during the ApoL1 testing process? (3) What do transplant centers identify as concerns and barriers to ApoL1 testing? and (4) What actions do transplant centers take when a potential donor has 2 ApoL1 risk variants? DESIGN: We explored the current practices of transplant centers by surveying nephrologists and transplant surgeons at transplant centers evaluating the majority of black living donors in  the United States. RESULTS: About half of these transplant centers offered ApoL1  testing. Of those who offered ApoL1 testing, only half involved the donor in decision-making about donation when the donor has 2 risk variants. DISCUSSION: Unaddressed differences in the priorities of transplant centers and black living  donors may stigmatize black donors and undermine trust in the health-care and organ donation systems. Variation in transplant center testing practices points to the critical need for further research and community engagement to inform the  development of guidelines for ApoL1 testing.;;McIntosh T, Mohan S, Sawinski D, Iltis A, DuBois JM;;eng;"['African Americans', 'Apolipoprotein L1/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*blood', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Male', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*standards"", 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']";['*ApoL1', '*ethics', '*kidney transplant', '*living organ donors', '*transplant center'];;R01 MD014161/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States;10.1177/1526924819892917

Doppler ultrasound evaluation is routinely used after liver transplantation; however, there is no consensus defining normal values, timing or frequency of Doppler ultrasound postoperative evaluation. Identification of patients who require an intervention or change in postoperative management is therefore challenging. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to appraise and synthesise evidence describing Doppler ultrasound measurements and their association with graft complications in children who have received a liver  transplant. We will search multiple databases: Ovid Medline, Embase, Wiley Cochrane Library, Web of Science-Science Citation Index Expanded, trial registry  records and meeting abstracts using a combination of subject headings and keywords for liver transplantation, Doppler ultrasound and paediatric patients.

Selected studies will be retrieved and subjected to a second phase of  screening, both selection phases will be done in duplicate by two independent reviewers, and discrepancies will be documented and resolved by a third reviewer. Data extraction will be done independently by two reviewers using a standardised  data extraction form. Quality of evidence and risk of bias will be assessed, synthesised and pooled for meta-analysis if possible. We will perform a subgroup  analysis if enough data are available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Strategies to disseminate our review include presenting in liver transplant review sessions, publishing in high-impact peer-reviewed medical journals, and presenting at national and international paediatric radiology and liver transplant meetings, conference presentations, events, courses and plain-language summaries. This knowledge will allow easier identification of patients with a higher risk of developing graft-related complications and could potentially improve patient and  graft outcomes. We wish to disseminate our results to discover potential areas for future research and drive improved future practices and policies. Our target  audience includes researchers, institutions, healthcare professionals, health system decision-makers, policy-makers and research funders community.

1702;31787324;Article;2020;Transplantation proceedings;;Comparison of Graft Outcome Between Donation After Circulatory Death and Living-Donor Kidney Transplantation.;;"BACKGROUND: Donation after cardiac death (DCD) and living-donor (LD) kidney transplantation are the main kidney transplantation types in China. But the outcome of DCD kidney transplantation compared with LD kidney transplantation remains unclear. METHODS: In this study, 325 DCD and 409 LD kidney transplantations were included. We retrospectively compared 3-year graft survival, death-censored graft survival, recipient survival, and graft function.  All kidneys of the DCD group were procured from voluntary donation after the citizens' death by the Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) in the presence of the Red Cross, and the transplantation application was approved by the Organ Transplant Ethics Committee. RESULTS: The graft function at year 3 in the DCD group was superior to that of the LD group (eGFR: 71.14+/-22.28 vs 64.29+/-16.76  mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). After matching donor age, there was no significant difference between the paired DCD and LD group (eGFR: 62.22+/-18.50 vs 66.99+/-17.81 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .068). The 3-year graft survival (94.7% vs 97.4%; P = .041) and recipient survival (97.2% vs 99.5%; P = .011) were a little  worse in the total DCD group. However, once the DCD kidney transplantation recipients survived more than 2 months, graft and recipient survival rates were similar between the DCD and LD groups (97.7% vs 97.4%, P = .866 and 99.5% vs 99.0%, P = .466). These results were confirmed in an age-paired groups study. Severe infection was the main cause of graft loss and recipient death in the early stage of DCD transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Medium- and long-term graft function of DCD kidney transplantation were comparable to LD kidney transplantation. Our results supported the continued use of DCD kidneys.";;Zhang X, Lyu J, Yu X, Wang L, Peng W, Chen J, Wu J;;eng;['Adult', 'China', 'Death', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods', 'Transplants/*statistics & numerical data'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2019.10.001

1714;31732828;Article;2019;Theoretical medicine and bioethics;;When is somebody just some body? Ethics as first philosophy and the brain death debate.;;I, along with others, have been critical of the social construction of brain death and the various social factors that led to redefining death from cardiopulmonary failure to irreversible loss of brain functioning, or brain death. Yet this does not mean that brain death is not the best threshold to permit organ harvesting-or, as people today prefer to call it, organ procurement. Here I defend whole-brain death as a morally legitimate line that, once crossed,  is grounds for families to give permission for organ donation. I do so in five moves. First, I make the case that whole-brain death is a social construction that transformed one thing, coma depasse, into another thing, brain death, as a result of social pressures. Second, I explore the way that the 1981 President's Commission tried to establish the epistemological certainty of brain death, hoping to avoid making arcane metaphysical claims and yet still utilizing metaphysical claims about human beings. Third, I explore the moral meaning of the social construction of a definition that cannot offer metaphysical certainty about the point at which somebody becomes just some body. Fourth, I describe how  two moral communities-Jewish and Catholic-actually ground their metaphysical positions with regard to brain death in the normativity of prior social relations. Finally, I conclude with a reflection on the aesthetic-moral enterprise of the metaphysical-epistemological apparatus of brain death, concluding that only such an aesthetic-moral approach is sufficiently strong to stave off the utility-maximizing tendencies of late-modern Western cultures.;;Bishop JP;;eng;['*Brain Death', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Brain death', 'Definition of death', 'Ethics', 'Metaphysics', 'Organ donation'];;;10.1007/s11017-019-09508-6

The Research in West Poland.;;The most urgent issue in transplantology nowadays is to increase the number of donors as replacement of lungs, heart, and liver in end-stage disease remains the only available method to save patients. Donors after brain death (DBD), these after irreversible cessation of brain function, represent 95% of all donors. On the contrary, donors after circulatory death (DCD), namely donors after irreversible detention of circulation, a group of great potential, is totally unused. The survey was done among 500 people from the medical staff of the intensive care unit and intensive cardiological care where the probability of receiving anonymous donation after circulatory death is the highest, yet only 368 people had completed the survey and their cases were taken into consideration as  far as the study was concerned. The survey was conducted in the form of a self-projected questionnaire based on the Hospital Attitude Survey. The study showed that 98.4% of respondents accept the transplant.

1717;31722695;Article;2019;BMC medical ethics;;Analysis of official deceased organ donation data casts doubt on the credibility  of China's organ transplant reform.;;BACKGROUND: Since 2010 the People's Republic of China has been engaged in an effort to reform its system of organ transplantation by developing a voluntary organ donation and allocation infrastructure. This has required a shift in the procurement of organs sourced from China's prison and security apparatus to hospital-based voluntary donors declared dead by neurological and/or circulatory  criteria. Chinese officials announced that from January 1, 2015, hospital-based donors would be the sole source of organs. This paper examines the availability,  transparency, integrity, and consistency of China's official transplant data. METHODS: Forensic statistical methods were used to examine key deceased organ donation datasets from 2010 to 2018. Two central-level datasets - published by the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS) and the Red Cross Society of China - are tested for evidence of manipulation, including conformance to simple  mathematical formulae, arbitrary internal ratios, the presence of anomalous data  artefacts, and cross-consistency. Provincial-level data in five regions are tested for coherence, consistency, and plausibility, and individual hospital data in those provinces are examined for consistency with provincial-level data. RESULTS: COTRS data conforms almost precisely to a mathematical formula (which first appeared to be a general quadratic, but with further confirmatory data was  discovered to be a simpler one-parameter quadratic) while Central Red Cross data  mirrors it, albeit imperfectly. The analysis of both datasets suggests human-directed data manufacture and manipulation. Contradictory, implausible, or  anomalous data artefacts were found in five provincial datasets, suggesting that  these data may have been manipulated to enforce conformity with central quotas. A number of the distinctive features of China's current organ procurement and allocation system are discussed, including apparent misclassification of nonvoluntary donors as voluntary. CONCLUSION: A variety of evidence points to what the authors believe can only be plausibly explained by systematic falsification and manipulation of official organ transplant datasets in China. Some apparently nonvoluntary donors also appear to be misclassified as voluntary. This takes place alongside genuine voluntary organ transplant activity, which is  often incentivized by large cash payments. These findings are relevant for international interactions with China's organ transplantation system.;;Robertson MP, Hinde RL, Lavee J;;eng;['China', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*organization & administration/standards'];['*Data falsification', '*Organ donation', '*Organ transplantation', '*Organ transplantation in China', '*Statistical forensics', '*Transplant ethics'];;;10.1186/s12910-019-0406-6

As a proxy for medical urgency, the US heart allocation system ranks heart transplant candidates largely according to the supportive therapy prescribed by transplant centers. Objective: To determine if there is a significant association between transplant center and survival benefit in the US heart allocation system. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational study of 29199 adult candidates for heart transplant listed on the  national transplant registry from January 2006 through December 2015 with follow-up complete through August 2018. Exposures: Transplant center. Main Outcomes and Measures: The survival benefit associated with heart transplant as defined by the difference between survival after heart transplant and waiting list survival without transplant at 5 years. Each transplant center's mean survival benefit was estimated using a mixed-effects proportional hazards model with transplant as a time-dependent covariate, adjusted for year of transplant, donor quality, ischemic time, and candidate status. Results: Of 29199 candidates  (mean age, 52 years; 26% women) on the transplant waiting list at 113 centers, 19815 (68%) underwent heart transplant. Among heart transplant recipients, 5389 (27%) died or underwent another transplant operation during the study period. Of  the 9384 candidates who did not undergo heart transplant, 5669 (60%) died (2644 while on the waiting list and 3025 after being delisted). Estimated 5-year survival was 77% (interquartile range [IQR], 74% to 80%) among transplant recipients and 33% (IQR, 17% to 51%) among those who did not undergo heart transplant, which is a survival benefit of 44% (IQR, 27% to 59%). Survival benefit ranged from 30% to 55% across centers and 31 centers (27%) had significantly higher survival benefit than the mean and 30 centers (27%) had significantly lower survival benefit than the mean. Compared with low survival benefit centers, high survival benefit centers performed heart transplant for patients with lower estimated expected waiting list survival without transplant (29% at high survival benefit centers vs 39% at low survival benefit centers; survival difference, -10% [95% CI, -12% to -8.1%]), although the adjusted 5-year  survival after transplant was not significantly different between high and low survival benefit centers (77.6% vs 77.1%, respectively; survival difference, 0.5% [95% CI, -1.3% to 2.3%]). Overall, for every 10% decrease in estimated transplant candidate waiting list survival at a given center, there was an increase of 6.2%  (95% CI, 5.2% to 7.3%) in the 5-year survival benefit associated with heart transplant. Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based study of US heart transplant candidates, transplant center was associated with the survival benefit of transplant. Although the adjusted 5-year survival after transplant was not significantly different between high and low survival benefit centers, compared with centers with survival benefit significantly below the mean, centers with survival benefit significantly above the mean performed heart transplant for recipients who had significantly lower estimated expected 5-year waiting list survival without transplant.";;Parker WF, Anderson AS, Gibbons RD, Garrity ER Jr, Ross LF, Huang ES, Churpek MM;;eng;['Adult', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Acuity', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Registries', 'Resource Allocation', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Waiting Lists'];;;K08 HL121080/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1001/jama.2019.15686

Analysis: When a patient has devastating brain injury that might progress to organ donation this can be conceptualized as evolving through four consecutive stages: (1) instability, (2)  stability, (3) futility and (4) finality. ICOP might be applied at any of these stages, raising different ethical issues. Only in the stage of finality is the switch from neurointensive care to ICOP ethically justified. Conclusion: The difference between the stages is that during instability, stability and futility  the focus must be neurointensive care which seeks the patient's recovery or an accurate neurological prognostication, while finality focuses on withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and commencement of comfort care, which may include ICOP  for deceased donation.;;Gardiner D, Shaw DM, Kilcullen JK, Dalle Ave AL;;eng;;['Transplantation', 'brain death', 'ethics', 'intensive care', 'organ donation', 'organ preservation'];;;10.1177/1751143719840254

For those most in need, the National Living Donor Assistance Center (NLDAC) provides reimbursement to defray  travel and subsistence costs associated with living donor evaluation, surgery, and follow-up. While this program currently supports 9% of all US living donors,  there is tremendous variability in its utilization across US transplant centers,  which may limit patient access to living donor transplantation. Based on feedback from the transplant community, NLDAC convened a Best Practices Workshop on August 2, 2018, in Arlington, VA, to identify strategies to optimize transplant program  utilization of this valuable resource. Attendees included team members from transplant centers that are high NLDAC users; the NLDAC program team; and Advisory Group members. After a robust review of NLDAC data and engagement in group discussions, the workgroup identified concrete best practices for administrative and transplant center leadership involvement; for individuals filing NLDAC applications at transplant centers; and to improve patient education about potential financial barriers to living organ donation. Multiple opportunities were identified for intervention to increase transplant programs' NLDAC utilization and reduce financial burdens inhibiting expansion of living donor transplantation in the United States.";;Mathur AK, Stewart Lewis ZA, Warren PH, Walters MC, Gifford KA, Xing J, Goodrich NP, Bennett R, Brownson A, Ellefson J, Felan G, Gray B, Hays RE, Klein-Glover C, Lagreco S, Metzler N, Provencher K, Walz E, Warmke K, Merion RM, Ojo AO;;eng;['Financing, Government', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Needs Assessment/*standards', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics', 'Travel/*economics'];['*donors and donation: living', '*ethics and public policy', '*kidney disease', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*patient education', '*transplant coordinator', '*transplant social worker'];;U13HS30586/HRSA/HRSA HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.15684
1723;31676348;Article;2020;Annals of anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger : official organ of the Anatomische Gesellschaft;;Attitudes of Turkish university employees and their relatives towards whole body  and organ donation.;;BACKGROUND: Dissection of human anatomic specimens still keeps its importance in  medical curriculum. Experiences of medical students in the anatomy laboratory and the time they spent there makes them feel as doctors at the beginning of their education and helps them to get used to the notion of death. Unfortunately, the number of human body donors available for medical research and education as well  as organ transplantation is limited. Obtaining human anatomic specimens continues being a great problem especially in middle-east countries. Religious factors, socioeconomic status, education, marital status or age are probably the main factors those effect body donations. The aim of the present study is to evaluate  the attitudes of Turkish university employees and their relatives towards whole body donation and organ donation. METHODS: A total of 780 questionnaires taken from the participants were evaluated. All the participants were academic and administrative staff from four different universities based in Ankara, Eskisehir, Istanbul and Adana and their relatives. Participants were between the ages of 18-85. All the subjects were provided a questionnaire composed of 38 questions. FINDINGS: 26.2% of the individuals declared that they could donate their body for medical education while 73.8% of them did not. In contrast, 69.1% of the participants were willing for being organ donors. Of the ones who had accepted to donate their organs, 64.5% refused to donate their bodies. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that not only whole body donation, but also organ  donation continue being a problem in Turkey.;;Oktem H, Pelin C, Kurkcuoglu A, Yildirim RV, Yazici Guvercin AC;;eng;['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Educational Status', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Marital Status', 'Middle Aged', 'Religion', 'Sex Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/statistics & numerical data', 'Turkey', 'Universities/*ethics', 'Young Adult'];['Anatomy education', 'Body donation', 'Body donors', 'Organ donation'];;;10.1016/j.aanat.2019.151426

The GKE programme pays the medical expenses of people in medium-income and low-income countries, thus enabling them to receive a kidney transplantation they otherwise could not afford. In doing so, the programme increases the global donor pool, and so benefits people in high-income countries  by improving their chances of finding a donor match. Nevertheless, the GKE has been accused of being a form of organ trafficking, exploiting the poor, and involving coercion and commodification of donors. We refute these claims, arguing that the GKE promotes global justice and reduces the potential for people in need of kidneys in low-income and medium-income countries to be exploited. Misguided objections should not be allowed to prevent the GKE from realising its potential  to reduce suffering and save the lives of rich and poor patients alike.;;Minerva F, Savulescu J, Singer P;;eng;['Directed Tissue Donation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Organ Trafficking/ethics', 'Socioeconomic Factors'];;;;10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32474-2

We also examined the effects on OPO costs of the recovery of nonviable (ie, discarded) kidneys and other OPO metrics. Annual cost reports from 51 independent OPOs were used to determine the cost per recovered kidney for each OPO. A quadratic regression model was employed to estimate the relationship between the  cost of kidneys and the number of viable kidneys recovered, as well as other OPO  performance indicators. The cost of transplanted kidneys at individual OPOs ranged widely from $24 000 to $56 000, and the average was $36 000. The cost of a viable kidney tended to decline with the number of kidneys procured up to 549 kidneys per year and then increase. Of the total 81 401 kidneys recovered, 66 454 were viable and 14 947 (18.4%) were nonviable. The costs of kidneys varied widely over the OPOs studied, and costs were a function of the recovered number of viable and nonviable organs, local cost levels, donation after cardiac death, year, and Standardized Donor Rate Ratio.

1727;31655526;Article;2019;Turkish journal of medical sciences;;Retrospective evaluation of anesthetic techniques in pregnant women with renal transplantation;;Background/aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate anesthesia management in cesarean operation of pregnant women who underwent renal transplantation and the  effects on postoperative renal function, retrospectively. Materials and methods:  After obtaining the approval of the ethics committee of our hospital, the records of pregnant women who underwent kidney transplantation and cesarean section between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients' demographic data, concomitant disease history, the treatment received, and type of anesthesia were retrospectively evaluated and recorded in the follow-up form. Results: It was found that a total of 47 women who underwent renal transplantation had 47 live births by cesarean section. The mean age of the pregnant women was 30 +/- 5.34 years. The mean time between renal transplantation and conception was 95.34  +/- 55.02 months. It was found that 14 (29%) of a total of 47 patients had their  first pregnancy. The number of patients with a gravidity of 4 and above was 9 (19%). A total of 21 (44.7%) pregnant women had spontaneous miscarriage. Five (10.6%) patients were treated with curettage for therapeutic purposes. Twenty-two (46%) of the patients whose immunosuppressive therapy was continuing were treated with azathioprine, tacrolimus, and prednisolone. The mean gestational age of delivery was 36.5 +/- 1.59 weeks. The rate of prepregnancy hypertension diagnosis was 25.5% (n = 12), while the rate of developing gestational hypertension was 21.3% (n = 10). Spinal anesthesia was administered to 42 (91%) of 47 patients who underwent cesarean section. In the preoperative period, the mean value of serum blood urea nitrogen was 62.88 +/- 41.97 mg/dL and the mean serum creatinine level was 3.21 +/- 6.17 mg/dL. In the postoperative period, these values were 44.4 +/-  29.9 mg/dL and 1.91 +/- 1.63 mg/dL, respectively. When the pre- and postoperative serum urea and creatinine levels were compared, they were found to be lower in the postoperative period. However, there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). The mean weight of the newborns was determined as 2707.3 +/- 501.5 g. While the number of newborns with a low birth weight (<2500 g) was 18 (38%), among them 3 (0.6%) were below 2000 g. It was found that 36.2% (n = 17) of the newborns required intensive care. None of the patients developed graft rejection. Conclusion: If there is no contraindication, regional anesthesia may be preferred in the first place for pregnant women with renal transplantation. We suggest that this method of anesthesia has some advantages in terms of maintaining postoperative renal function and higher Apgar scores in newborns with low birth weight.;;Sargin A, Karaman S, Ceylan Ari S, Akdemir A, Hortu I;;eng;['Adult', 'Anesthesia/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Anesthesia, Spinal/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Apgar Score', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Cesarean Section/*methods', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies'];['*obstetric anesthesia', '*pregnancy', '*renal transplantation'];none declared;;10.3906/sag-1905-59

We examine whether using social support to make listing decisions for adults seeking transplantation is morally legitimate, drawing on recent data about the evidence-base, implementation, and potential impacts of the criterion on underserved and diverse populations. We demonstrate that the rationale for the social support criterion, based in the principle of utility, is undermined by its reliance on tenuous evidence. Moreover, social support requirements may reinforce transplant inequities, interfere in patients'  personal relationships, and contribute to biased and inconsistent listing procedures. As such, accommodating the needs of patients with limited social support would better balance ethical commitments to equity, utility, and respect  for persons in transplantation. We suggest steps for researchers, transplantation programs, and policymakers to improve fair use of social support in transplantation.;;Berry KN, Daniels N, Ladin K;;eng;['Adult', 'Bias', 'Clinical Decision-Making/ethics/methods', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics/methods', '*Health Equity', 'Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', '*Social Support'];['ethics', 'health care rationing', 'health policy', 'inequities', 'justice', 'organ transplantation', 'social support'];;;10.1080/15265161.2019.1665728

Such transplants raise ethical questions  about safety, consent, and access to organs. Methods: We interviewed eight of the ten total HCV D+/R- transplant recipients enrolled in a pilot clinical trial examining the safety and feasibility of these novel transplants regarding their experiences in the trial, including their decision-making and perceptions of the  informed consent process. Results: All interviewees reported positive experiences and expressed confidence regarding their decision to participate. Participants accepted an HCV + organ based on their assessments of the risks and potential benefits of HCV D+/R- transplants. For many, the risks of HCV were minimal compared to the risks of not receiving a transplant. All participants recalled providing informed consent, reporting that the process was thorough and that all  their questions were addressed. Participants did not regret receiving an HCV D+/R- transplant and did not report experiencing stigma. However, given their understanding of HCV cure rates in the general population and the survival benefit associated with kidney transplantation, participants may have conflated research regarding HCV D+/R- transplantation with clinical care, suggesting a potential therapeutic misconception. Conclusions: Recipients of experimental HCV  D+/R- transplants generally seemed to recognize the risks and benefits of these novel transplants and did not regret participating. Such salutary reported experiences are important in assessing the appropriateness of further research into the feasibility of HCV D+/R- transplants.;;Van Pilsum Rasmussen SE, Seaman S, Brown D, Desai N, Sulkowski M, Segev DL, Durand CM, Sugarman J;;eng;['Aged', 'Decision Making/ethics', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk Assessment', 'Therapeutic Misconception', 'Therapies, Investigational/*ethics', 'Transplant Recipients/*psychology', 'United States/epidemiology'];['*Transplantation', '*hepatitis C', '*interview', '*qualitative research', '*research ethics'];;K23 CA177321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;10.1080/23294515.2019.1670277

Nevertheless, despite extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use, mortality still remains high (50%). Moderate hypothermia (MH) (33 degrees C-34 degrees C) may improve cardiac performance and decrease ischaemia-reperfusion injuries. The  use of MH during VA-ECMO is strongly supported by experimental and preliminary clinical data. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Hypothermia-Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (HYPO-ECMO) study is a multicentre, prospective, controlled randomised trial between an MH group (33 degrees C</=T degrees C</=34 degrees C)  and normothermia group (36 degrees C</=T degrees C</=37 degrees C). The primary endpoint is all-cause mortality at day 30 following randomisation. The study will also assess as secondary endpoints the effects of targeted temperature management strategies on (1) mortality rate at different time points, (2) organ failure and  supportive treatment use and (3) safety. All intubated adults with refractory CS  supported with VA-ECMO will be screened. Exclusion criteria are patients having undergone cardiac surgery for heart transplantation or left or biventricular assist device implantation, acute poisoning with cardiotoxic drugs, pregnancy, uncontrolled bleeding and refractory cardiac arrest.Three-hundred and thirty-four patients will be randomised and followed up to 6 months to detect a 15% difference in mortality. Data analysis will be intention to treat. The differences between the two study groups in the risk of all-cause mortality at day 30 following randomisation will be studied using logistic regression analysis adjusted for postcardiotomy setting, prior cardiac arrest, prior myocardial infarction, age, vasopressor dose, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and lactate at randomisation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by the Comite de Protection des Personnes Est III Ethics Committee.  The trial has been approved by the French Health Authorities (Agence Nationale de la Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante). Dissemination of results will be performed via journal articles and presentations at national and international conferences. Since this study is also the first step in the constitution of an 'ECMO Trials Group', its results will also be disseminated by  the aforementioned group.

DuraGraft is a novel endothelial-damage inhibitor developed to efficiently protect the structural and  functional integrity of the vascular endothelium. The DuraGraft registry will evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of DuraGraft in patients undergoing CABG procedures. METHODS: This ongoing multicentre, prospective observational registry will enrol 3000 patients undergoing an isolated CABG procedure or a combined procedure (ie, CABG plus valve surgery or other surgery) with at least one saphenous vein grafts or one free arterial graft (ie, radial artery or mammary artery). If a patient is enrolled, all free grafts (SVG and arterial will be treated with DuraGraft. Data on baseline, clinical, and angiographic characteristics as well as procedural and clinical events will be collected. The  primary outcome measure is the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE; defined as death, non-fatal myocardial-infarction, or need for repeat-revascularisation). Secondary outcome measures are the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE; defined as death, non-fatal myocardial-infarction, repeat-revascularisation, or stroke), patient-reported quality of life, and health-economic data. Patient assessments will be performed  during hospitalisation, at 1-month, 1-year, and annually thereafter to 5 years post-CABG. Events will be adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. This European, multi-institutional registry will provide detailed insights into clinical outcome associated with DuraGraft. DISCUSSION: This European, multi-institutional registry will provide detailed insights into clinical outcome associated with the use of DuraGraft. Beyond that, and given the comprehensive data sets comprising of patient, procedural, and graft parameters that are being collected, the registry will enable for multiple subgroup analyses targeting focus groups or specific clinical questions. These may include analysis of subpopulations such as patients with diabetes or multimorbid high-risk patients (patient level), evaluation of relevance of harvesting technique including endoscopic versus open conduit harvesting (procedural level), or particular graft-specific aspects (conduit level).

Advances in medical knowledge and technology, and highly pluralistic and multicultural societies, have led to the emergence of new ethical problems in daily clinical practice along with the need to manage them in a prompt and effective manner. Clinical ethics developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s in  North American health care contexts with the aim of identifying, analyzing, and attempting to resolve ethical conflicts and dilemmas at the patient's bedside. At present, only a few regions in Italy have established clinical ethics committees, and Italy may count on a very small number of clinical ethics services fully devoted to ethics case consultation, guidelines development, and the education of health care providers and citizens. Despite this situation, one has to acknowledge both the increasing request for ethics support coming from health care providers who experience an ""ethical vacuum"" in the Italian health care system and the cultural change that is affecting Italy nowadays.

This genuine overruling of the wishes of the deceased raises  difficult ethical questions. A successful argument for providing the family with  a veto must (a) provide reason to disregard the wishes of the dead, and (b) establish why the family should be allowed to decide. One branch of justification seeks to reconcile the family veto with important ideas about respecting property rights, preserving autonomy, and preventing harm. These arguments are ultimately  unsuccessful. Another branch of arguments is consequentialist, pointing out the negative consequences of removing the veto. Whether construed as concerning family distress or as a potential drop in the organs available, these arguments are unsuccessful; the first fails to recognize the tremendous distress associated with waiting for an organ, while the second has little supporting evidence. A final section considers and rejects whether combining some of the arguments just  examined could justify the family veto.

1739;31581889;Article;2019;Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.);;A Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding Variation in Social Support Requirements and Implications for Access to Transplantation in the United States.;;Social support is a key component of transplantation evaluation in the United States. Social support definitions and evaluation procedures require examination  to achieve clear, consistent implementation. We surveyed psychosocial clinicians  from the Society for Transplant Social Workers and American Society of Transplant Surgeons about their definitions and evaluation procedures for using social support to determine transplant eligibility. Bivariate statistical analysis was used for quantitative data and content analysis for qualitative data. Among 276 psychosocial clinicians (50.2% response rate), 92% had ruled out patients from transplantation due to inadequate support. Social support definitions varied significantly: 10% of respondents indicated their center lacked a definition. Key domains of social support included informational, emotional, instrumental, motivational, paid support, and the patient's importance to others. Almost half of clinicians (47%) rarely or never requested second opinions when excluding patients due to social support.

Diagnostics further revealed a hitherto unknown pregnancy, at suspected week 9. Based on the patient's wish to donate organs, brain death protocol confirmed irreversible loss of brain function. Yet, vital pregnancy rendered organ transplantation impossible. Multiple ethical and legal issues arose, from invalidation of established legal care after brain death to the delivery of a healthy child after trauma and long-term critical care. After medicolegal and ethical counselling, pregnancy was sustained, and the goal of organ donation postponed. Critical care focused on foetal homeostasis. At 30+4 weeks, a viable girl was born via assisted vaginal delivery. Postpartal organ donation resulted in heart, kidney and pancreas transplantation. The case emphasises the medical, legal and ethical challenges to combine two apparently diametrical goals: the successful full-term pregnancy and the fulfilment of a patient's wish to donate organs.;;Reinhold AK, Kredel M, Markus CK, Kranke P;;eng;['Adult', 'Advance Directives', '*Brain Death', 'Counseling', 'Critical Care', 'Female', 'Fetal Viability/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Life Support Care/*ethics/methods', 'Living Donors/*ethics', '*Mothers', 'Patient Advocacy/*ethics', 'Patient Rights/ethics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prenatal Care/*ethics/methods', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['adult intensive care', 'ethics', 'pregnancy', 'trauma', 'trauma CNS/PNS'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/bcr-2019-231601
1742;31558463;Article;2019;BMJ open;;Factors influencing access to kidney transplantation: a research protocol of a qualitative study on stakeholders' perspectives.;;INTRODUCTION: Unequal access to kidney transplantation is suggested, but no systematic inventory exists about factors influencing access to kidney transplantation. There is an absence of any research that has combined stakeholder perspectives along the complete trajectory of transplantation. The present qualitative study explores the contributing factors from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in this trajectory, including patients, health professionals and health insurance and financial representatives in the Netherlands. Moreover, stakeholders will be invited to suggesting strategies and  solutions for handling the facilitating and hindering factors found. By means of  interaction, stakeholder groups will arrive at a consensus for new policymaking in the field of a Dutch transplantation care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The different stakeholders' perspectives and possible solutions will be explored by interviewing in three phases. In the first phase, stakeholders' group perspectives will be explored with individual interviews and focus group interviews without confrontation of views from other perspectives. In the second  phase of focus group interviewing, perspectives will be confronted with the other stakeholders' perspectives assessed. Finally, in the third phase, stakeholders will be invited to focus group discussions for suggesting solutions to overcome barriers and promote facilitators for improving access to transplantation. Approximately, groups from six to twelve participants per focus group and four to maximal six focus groups will be held per stakeholder, depending on the level of  saturation, as prescribed by grounded theory. The interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, and qualitative data will be analysed according to the principles of grounded theory supported by using NVivo software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Ethical Committee of Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, has approved this study.

Furthermore, anticipation of poor donor outcome may simultaneously be a source of anxiety for physicians and programs and also be a circumstance for which they are unprepared. We conducted a national survey of US transplant surgeons to understand experiences with and systemic preparedness for the event of a living donor death. Respondents represented 87 unique transplant programs (71 kidney and 16 liver donor programs). Perioperative deaths were rare, as expected. Although most respondents (N = 57, 64% of total respondents; 88% of liver programs) reported being moderately to extremely concerned about a future living donor death at their institution, only 30 (33% of total program respondents) had a written plan available in the case of such an event; 63% of programs would find guidance and recommendations useful.

Such research will not progress until ethical, regulatory, and legal issues are resolved regarding whether and how to obtain informed consent from transplant candidates offered intervention organs given time constraints intrinsic to distribution. This multi-center, mixed-methods study involved semi-structured interviews using open- and closed-ended questions to assess waitlisted candidates' preferences for informed consent processes if offered an organ after undergoing intervention. Data were analyzed thematically.  Sixty-one candidates participated (47% participation rate). Most were male (57%), white (61%), with a mean age of 56 years. Most candidates (79%) desired being informed that the organ offered was an intervention organ before accepting it, and were likely to accept an intervention organ if organ quality was good (defined as donor age 30) (81%), but fewer candidates would accept an intervention organ if quality was moderate (ie, donor age 50) (26%). Most perceived informed consent important for decision-making, while others considered it unnecessary given medical necessity to accept an organ and trust in their physician. Our findings suggest that most candidates desire an informed consent process before accepting an intervention organ and posttransplant data collection.;;Gordon EJ, Knopf E, Phillips C, Mussell A, Lee J, Veatch RM, Abt P, Dunn S, Reese PP;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics/*psychology', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology', 'Perception', 'Qualitative Research', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*methods', 'Waiting Lists', 'Young Adult'];['*deceased', '*donors and donation', '*education', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*health services and outcomes research', '*law/legislation', '*organ perfusion and preservation', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*qualitative research', '*social sciences'];;Greenwall Foundation/International;10.1111/ajt.15607

Evidence from US pilot programs suggests families support uDCDD, but only if they are asked permission for using invasive  organ preservation procedures prior to initiation. However, non-invasive strategies that confine oxygenation to lungs may be applicable to the overwhelming majority of potential uDCDD donors that have airway devices in place as part of standard resuscitation. We propose an ethical framework for lung uDCDD by: (a) initiating post mortem preservation without requiring prior permission to protect the opportunity for donation until an authorized party can be found; (b)  using non-invasive strategies that confine oxygenation to lungs; and (c) maintaining strict separation between the healthcare team and the organ preservation team. Attempting uDCDD in this way has great potential to obtain more transplantable lungs while respecting donor autonomy and family wishes, securing public support, and enabling authorized persons to affirm or cease preservation decisions without requiring evidence of prior organ donation intent. It ensures prioritization of life-saving, the opportunity to allow willing donors to donate, and respect for bodily integrity while adhering to current ethical norms.";;Parent B, Caplan A, Angel L, Kon Z, Dubler N, Goldfrank L, Lindner J, Wall SP;;eng;['Death', 'Donor Selection/*ethics/methods/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Organ Preservation/*ethics/methods', 'Professional-Family Relations', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/supply & distribution', 'United States'];['*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*donors and donation: extended criteria', '*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics and public policy', '*lung transplantation/pulmonology', '*organ procurement', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;R01 DK098610/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.15603
1747;31537615;Article;2020;Journal of medical ethics;;Will you give my kidney back? Organ restitution in living-related kidney transplantation: ethical analyses.;;In this article, we perform a thought experiment about living donor kidney transplantation. If a living kidney donor becomes in need of renal replacement treatment due to dysfunction of the remaining kidney after donation, can the donor ask the recipient to give back the kidney that had been donated? We call this problem organ restitution and discussed it from the ethical viewpoint. Living organ transplantation is a kind of 'designated donation' and subsequently  has a contract-like character. First, assuming a case in which original donor (A) wishes the return of the organ which had been transplanted into B, and the original recipient (B) agrees, organ restitution will be permissible based on contract-like agreement. However, careful and detailed consideration is necessary to determine whether this leaves no room to question the authenticity of B's consent. Second, if B offers to give back the organ to A, then B's act is a supererogatory act, and is praiseworthy and meritorious. Such an offer is a matter of virtue, not obligation. Third, if A wishes B to return the organ, but B does not wish/allow this to happen, it is likely difficult to justify returning the organ to A by violating B's right to bodily integrity. But B's refusal to return the donated organ cannot be deemed praiseworthy, because B forgets the great kindness once received from A. Rather than calling this an obligation, we encourage B to consider such virtuous conduct.;;Nakazawa E, Yamamoto K, Akabayashi A, Shaw MH, Demme RA, Akabayashi A;;eng;;['*living donor kidney transplantation organ restitution ethics'];;;10.1136/medethics-2019-105507

Nevertheless, the ethical discourses in both fields grew largely isolated from each other. METHODS: Based on a review of ethical, sociological and anthropological research this paper aims to link the ethical discourses on living kidney donation and surrogacy by providing a comparative analysis of the two practices' relational dimension with regard to three aspects, i.e. the normative role of relational dynamics, social norms and gender roles, and reciprocity. Based on this analysis, we derive conclusions for the framing of living organ donation and surrogacy in ethical theory and practice. RESULTS: First, our analysis emphasizes the relevance of acknowledging the complex relational implications of living kidney donation and surrogacy. Underestimating this relational dimension may not only lead to individual crises but endanger existing as well as newly emerging familial relationships. Second, we point out differences in the normative assessment of social norms and gender roles in the ethical debates about living kidney donation and surrogacy. In particular, we show how different evaluations of altruism affect the understanding of autonomy in both contexts. In addition, we sensitize  for biased perceptions of gender roles. Finally, we argue that challenges resulting from unresolved reciprocity are an issue in living kidney donation and  surrogacy independent of whether the exchange of body parts or bodily services is framed as a gift or commercial exchange. By pointing out the limits of financial  compensation, we stress the relevance of non-material, relational rewards as potential remedy.;;Beier K, Wohlke S;;eng;['Altruism', 'Ethical Theory', 'Humans', '*Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*ethics', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];['*Altruism', '*Commercialization', '*Comparison', '*Family', '*Motherhood', '*Personal relationships', '*Reciprocity', '*Third-party assisted reproduction'];;;10.1186/s13010-019-0080-9

The purpose of this analysis was to review the number and quality of  hearts in one United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Region that were not utilized as a potential consequence of nonheart DCD donation. We retrospectively  identified all successful US DCD solid organ donors from 1/2011 to 3/1/2017, defined an ideal heart donor by age and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and then reviewed the donor charts of unused hearts in New York and Vermont (UNOS Region 9). Of 8302 successful DCD donors across the United States,  5033 (61%) were between 18 and 49 years of age, and 872 had a screening echocardiogram, with 573 (66%) measuring an EF >50%. Of these 573 potential donors, 44 (7.7%) were from Region 9. Detailed donor chart review identified 36 ideal heart donors, 24 (66.7%) with anoxic brain injury. Trends in Region 9 DCD donation increased from 4 unused hearts in 2011, to 13 in 2016. In the context of severe organ scarcity, these data indicate that implementation of DCD heart transplantation in the United States would improve overall donation rates and provide a pathway to utilize these ideal donor hearts.;;Farr M, Truby LK, Lindower J, Jorde U, Taylor S, Chen L, Gass A, Stevens G, Reyentovich A, Mancini D, Arcasoy S, Delair S, Pinney S;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods', 'United States', 'Ventricular Function, Left/physiology', 'Young Adult'];['*clinical research/practice', '*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*donors and donation: donor evaluation', '*donors and donation: extended criteria', '*ethics and public policy', '*heart transplantation/cardiology'];;New York Cardiothoracic Transplant Consortium/International;10.1111/ajt.15597

For example, although there is an imperative to save human life and reduce suffering by maximising the supply of vital organs, there is an equally important obligation to ensure that the process by which we increase the supply respects the rights of all stakeholders. In a relatively unexamined practice in the USA, organs are procured from unrepresented decedents without their express consent. Unrepresented decedents have no known healthcare wishes or advance care  planning document; they also lack a surrogate. The Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (RUAGA) of 2006 sends a mixed message about the procurement of organs from this patient population and there are hospitals that authorise donation. In  addition, in adopting the RUAGA, some states included provisions that clearly allow organ procurement from unrepresented decedents. An important unanswered question is whether this practice meets the canons of ethical permissibility.

Specific questionnaires were developed to compile information on DCD practices, activities and post-transplant outcomes. Thirty-five countries completed the survey. DCD is practiced in 18 countries: eight have both controlled DCD (cDCD) and uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) programs, 4 only cDCD and 6 only uDCD. All these countries have legally binding and/or nonbinding texts to regulate the practice of DCD. The no-touch period ranges from 5 to 30 min. There are variations in ante and post mortem interventions used for  the practice of cDCD. During 2008-2016, the highest DCD activity was described in the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Data on post-transplant outcomes of patients who receive DCD donor kidneys show better results with grafts obtained from cDCD versus uDCD donors.

Oncology;;Solid organ transplantation after treatment for childhood cancer: a retrospective cohort analysis from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.;;"BACKGROUND: Serious chronic medical conditions occur in childhood cancer survivors. We aimed to investigate incidence of and risk factors for end-organ damage resulting in registration on a waiting list for or receiving a solid organ transplantation and 5-year survival following these procedures. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a retrospective cohort of individuals who survived at least 5 years after childhood cancer diagnosed at younger than 21 years of age, between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 1986, at one of 25 institutions in the USA. We linked data from CCSS participants treated in the USA diagnosed between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 1986 (without solid organ transplantation before cohort entry) to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network-a database of  all US organ transplants. Eligible participants had been diagnosed with leukaemia, lymphoma, malignant CNS tumours, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumours, and bone and soft tissue sarcomas. The two primary endpoints for each type of organ transplant were date of first registration of a transplant candidate on the waiting list for an organ and the date of the first transplant received. We also  calculated the cumulative incidence of being placed on a waiting list or receiving a solid organ transplantation, hazard ratios (HRs) for identified risk  factors, and 5-year survival following transplantation. FINDINGS: Of 13 318 eligible survivors, 100 had 103 solid organ transplantations (50 kidney, 37 heart, nine liver, seven lung) and 67 were registered on a waiting list without receiving a transplant (21 kidney, 25 heart, 15 liver, six lung). At 35 years after cancer diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of transplantation or being on a waiting list was 0.54% (95% CI 0.40-0.67) for kidney transplantation, 0.49% (0.36-0.62) for heart, 0.19% (0.10-0.27) for liver, and 0.10% (0.04-0.16) for lung. Risk factors for kidney transplantation were unilateral nephrectomy (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.3-7.7), ifosfamide (24.9, 7.4-83.5), total body irradiation (6.9, 2.3-21.1), and mean kidney radiation of greater than 15 Gy (>15-20 Gy, 3.6 [1.5-8.5]; >20 Gy 4.6 [1.1-19.6]); for heart transplantation, anthracycline and mean heart radiation of greater than 20 Gy (dose-dependent, both p<0.0001); for liver transplantation, dactinomycin (3.8, 1.3-11.3) and methotrexate (3.3, 1.0-10.2); for lung transplantation, carmustine (12.3, 3.1-48.9) and mean lung radiation of greater than 10 Gy (15.6, 2.6-92.7). 5-year overall survival after solid organ transplantation was 93.5% (95% CI 81.0-97.9) for kidney transplantation, 80.6% (63.6-90.3) for heart, 27.8% (4.4-59.1) for liver, and 34.3% (4.8-68.6) for lung. INTERPRETATION: Solid organ transplantation is uncommon in ageing childhood cancer survivors. Organ-specific exposures were associated with increased solid organ transplantation incidence. Survival outcomes showed that solid organ transplantation should be considered for 5-year  childhood cancer survivors with severe end-organ failure.

Results: Among the 280041 kidney transplant candidates included in the study, the mean (SD) age at wait-listing was 51.1 (13.1) years, and male patients were predominant (171 517 [61.2%]). In this cohort, 81 750 candidates (29.2%) received a deceased donor kidney allograft, 30 870 (11.0%) received a living donor allograft, 25 967 (9.3%) died while on the waiting list, and 59 359 (21.2%) were  removed from the waiting list. Overall, 10 candidates with at least 1 previous allograft offer died each day during the study period. Time to first offer was similar for candidates who received deceased donor kidney allograft compared with those who died while waiting (median [interquartile range {IQR}] time, 79 [16-426] days vs 78 [17-401] days, respectively). Deceased donor allograft recipients had a median of 17 offers (IQR, 6-44) over 422 days (IQR, 106-909 days), whereas candidates who died while waiting received a median of 16 offers (IQR, 6-41) over 651 days (IQR, 304-1117 days). Most kidneys (84%) were declined  on behalf of at least 1 candidate before being accepted for transplant. As reported by centers, organ or donor quality concerns accounted for 8 416 474 (92.6%) of all declined offers, whereas offers were infrequently refused because  of patient-related factors (232 193 [2.6%]), logistical limitations (49 492 [0.5%]), or other concerns. The odds of death after an offer and the median number of offers received prior to death varied considerably by state. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that transplant candidates appeared to receive a large number of viable deceased donor kidney offers that were refused on their behalf by transplant centers, potentially exacerbating the detrimental consequences of the organ shortage; increased transparency in organ allocation process and decisions may improve patient-centered care and access to  kidney transplant.";;Husain SA, King KL, Pastan S, Patzer RE, Cohen DJ, Radhakrishnan J, Mohan S;;eng;['Adult', 'Allografts/statistics & numerical data/*supply & distribution/transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/ethics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/epidemiology/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient-Centered Care/ethics', 'Tissue Donors/classification/*statistics & numerical data/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Transplant Recipients/statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Waiting Lists/mortality'];;;R01 DK114893/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.10312

The monitoring of cell immunity against CMV could be an alternative as it has shown to be useful in identifying transplant patients at low risk of infection, who could benefit from shorter prophylaxis. The aim of the CYTOCOR study is to demonstrate that the combination of a reduced prophylaxis strategy with subsequent CMV-specific immunological monitoring would allow CMV infection to be controlled in lung transplant patients as effectively as the usual strategy (prophylaxis followed by pre-emptive therapy), while reducing the side effects of antivirals due to the shorter duration of prophylaxis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Phase III randomised, open, multicentre, parallel, non-inferiority clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of the combination of a prophylaxis strategy up  to month +3 post-transplant followed by immuno-guided prophylaxis using the QuantiFERON-CMV technique up to month +12 post-transplant to prevent CMV disease  in CMV-seropositive lung transplant recipients. This strategy will be compared with a combination of a usual prophylaxis strategy up to month +6 post-transplant followed by pre-emptive therapy up to month +12. To study the incidence of CMV disease, patients will be followed up to 18 months post-transplantation. A total  of 150 patients are expected to be recruited for the study. ETHICS AND PUBLIC DISSEMINATION: The clinical trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees and authorised by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices  (AEMPS).If the hypothesis of this clinical trial is verified, the dissemination of the results could change clinical practice by increasing knowledge about the safety and efficacy of discontinuing valganciclovir prophylaxis in lung transplant recipients.

1761;31420387;Article;2019;BMJ open;;Transplantation of high-risk donor livers after resuscitation and viability assessment using a combined protocol of oxygenated hypothermic, rewarming and normothermic machine perfusion: study protocol for a prospective, single-arm study (DHOPE-COR-NMP trial).;;"INTRODUCTION: Extended criteria donor (ECD) livers are increasingly accepted for  transplantation in an attempt to reduce the gap between the number of patients on the waiting list and the available number of donor livers. ECD livers; however, carry an increased risk of developing primary non-function (PNF), early allograft dysfunction (EAD) or post-transplant cholangiopathy. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) plays an important role in the development of these complications. Machine  perfusion reduces IRI and allows for reconditioning and subsequent evaluation of  liver grafts. Single or dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (DHOPE) (4  degrees C-12 degrees C) decreases IRI by resuscitation of mitochondria. Controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR) may further reduce IRI by preventing sudden temperature shifts. Subsequent normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) (37 degrees C) allows for ex situ viability assessment to facilitate the selection of ECD livers with a low risk of PNF, EAD or post-transplant cholangiopathy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective, single-arm study is designed to resuscitate and evaluate initially nationwide declined ECD livers. End-ischaemic DHOPE will be performed for the initial mitochondrial and graft resuscitation, followed by COR  of the donor liver to a normothermic temperature. Subsequently, NMP will be continued to assess viability of the liver. Transplantation into eligible recipients will proceed if all predetermined viability criteria are met within the first 150 min of NMP. To facilitate machine perfusion at different temperatures, a perfusion solution containing a haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier  will be used. With this protocol, we aim to transplant extra livers. The primary  endpoint is graft survival at 3 months after transplantation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the medical ethical committee of Groningen, METc2016.281 in August 2016 and registered in the Dutch Trial registration number TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR5972, NCT02584283.";;de Vries Y, Berendsen TA, Fujiyoshi M, van den Berg AP, Blokzijl H, de Boer MT, van der Heide F, de Kleine RHJ, van Leeuwen OB, Matton APM, Werner MJM, Lisman T, de Meijer VE, Porte R;;eng;['Blood Substitutes', 'Graft Survival', 'Hemoglobins', 'Hepatic Artery', 'Humans', 'Hypothermia, Induced', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods', 'Organ Preservation/*methods', '*Organ Preservation Solutions', 'Portal Vein', 'Prospective Studies', 'Resuscitation', 'Rewarming', '*Tissue Survival', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting'];['*extended criteria donor liver', '*haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier', '*liver transplantation', '*machine perfusion', '*viability testing'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028596

The ethical challenges of harvesting tissue from savior siblings.;;PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To discuss the ethical challenges for the therapeutic team  when dealing with a young savior sibling as a potential tissue donor. BASIC PROCEDURES: Savior siblings are children that are created to serve a sibling as a donor of umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, or peripheral blood from which hematopoietic stem cells are derived. These cells are used for hematopoietic stem cell therapy, which is the only curative treatment for certain hemoglobinopathies. We used a case including a 19-year-old thalassemia patient and his two and a half year old sister from our practice as ethics consultants. Our methodological basis is the principlism approach by Beauchamp and Childress,  consisting of four principles: autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. MAIN FINDINGS: We found that the main conflict arises between the autonomy of the savior sibling as well as the non-maleficence regarding her and the beneficence of the thalassemia patient. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making is complex when decisions within the family are concerned, especially when non-competent young children are involved. The therapeutic team does not only have to recognize the principal vulnerability of children but also  the different scales of vulnerability depending on their age.;;Rubeis G, Steger F;;eng;['Adult', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Principle-Based Ethics', '*Siblings', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Young Adult'];['beta-thalassemia', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'ethics', 'fanconi anemia', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'savior sibling', 'stem cell therapy'];;;10.1111/ejh.13313
1763;31407946;Article;2019;Policy, politics & nursing practice;;Organ Donation After Circulatory Death and Before Death: Ethical Questions and Nursing Implications.;;Scientific advances have enabled thousands of individuals to extend their lives through organ donation. Yet, shortfalls of available organs persist, and individuals in the United States die daily before they receive what might have been lifesaving organs. For years, the legal foundation of organ donation in the  United States has been known as the Dead Donor Rule, requiring death to be defined for organ donation purposes by either a cardiac standard (termination of  the heartbeat) or a neurological one (cessation of all brain function). In this context, one solution used by an increasing number of health care facilities since 2006 is donation after circulatory death, generally defined as when care is withdrawn from individuals who have known residual brain function. Despite its increased use, donation after circulatory death remains ethically controversial.  In addition, some ethicists have advocated forgoing the Dead Donor Rule altogether and allowing donation before or near death in certain circumstances. However, nurses and other health professionals must carefully consider the practical and ethical implications of broadening the Dead Donor Rule-as may be already occurring-or removing it entirely. Such changes could harm both the integrity of the health care system as well as efforts to secure organ donation commitments from the public and are outweighed by the moral and pragmatic cost. Nurses should be prepared to confront the challenge posed by the ongoing scarcity of organs and advocate for ethical alternatives including research on effective care pathways and education regarding organ donation.;;de Tantillo L, Gonzalez JM, Ortega J;;eng;"['Critical Care/*ethics', 'Human Body', 'Humans', 'Morals', ""*Nurse's Role"", 'Tissue Donors/ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics/*nursing', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'United States']";['bioethics', 'death', 'tissue and organ procurement', 'tissue donors', 'transplantation'];;;10.1177/1527154419864717
1764;31378471;Article;2019;Transplantation proceedings;;Reasons Why Organs From Deceased Donors Were Not Accepted for Transplantation.;;INTRODUCTION: The rate of organ donations from deceased donors in Turkey is among the lowest in the world. We analyzed the reasons why some potential donors whose  families had given consent did not become actual solid organ donors. METHODS: We  retrospectively reviewed the organ donation, retrieval, and transplantation registries of 102 potential donors from the Ministry of Health Organ and Tissue Transplant Coordination Centre of Istanbul Region from the year 2015. RESULTS: Cardiac arrest occurred in 8 of the potential donors while waiting for organ procurement or during surgery. The organ specific suitability ratio was 83% for kidneys, 82% for livers, 72% for hearts, and 75% for lungs. Of these suitable organs, the transplantation rates were as follows: kidneys 88%, livers 70%, hearts 30%, and lungs 13%. Medical reasons (donor unsuitable) (14%-24%) and poor  organ function (2%-24%) were the reasons most organs were not accepted for transplant. These reasons included diabetes insipidus, electrolyte imbalance caused by neuro-humoral changes, inotrope/vasopressor requirement for hemodynamic instability, hypoperfusion, and myocardial dysfunction after brain death. CONCLUSION: The mismatch between organ donation and demand is a major problem worldwide. In addition to low organ donation rates, late diagnosis of potential donors or inappropriate management of the pathophysiological consequences of brain death reduce the number of transplantable organs even more in our country.  In order to overcome these setbacks, we need education programs to improve quality and decrease donor losses in an intensive care unit goal-directed protocol for the management of potential donors.;;Tore Altun G, Corman Dincer P, Birtan D, Arslantas R, Kasap Yakin D, Ozdemir I, Arslantas MK;;eng;['Brain Death', 'Heart Arrest/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*statistics & numerical data', 'Transplants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Turkey/epidemiology'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2019.01.158
1765;31375547;Article;2019;Journal of medical ethics;;What constitutes a reasonable compensation for non-commercial oocyte donors: an analogy with living organ donation and medical research participation.;;There is a growing consensus that the offer of a reasonable compensation for oocyte donation for reproductive treatment is acceptable if it does not compromise voluntary and altruistically motivated donation. However, how to translate this 'reasonable compensation' in practice remains unclear as compensation rates offered to oocyte donors between different European Union countries vary significantly. Clinics involved in oocyte donation, as well as those in other medical contexts, might be encouraged in calculating a more consistent and transparent compensation for donors if the elements that constitute a reasonable compensation are explicated. In doing so, lessons can be  learnt from living organ donation and medical research participation. Practices in which the elements of a reasonable compensation for the individuals involved have already been more defined in the literature. By means of analogical reasoning, we will outline the different components of a reasonable compensation  and subsequently apply these to the context of oocyte donation. We will argue that oocyte donors should first of all be reasonably reimbursed direct expenses related to the donation, without standard remuneration of lost wages. Second, donating oocytes requests a serious time investment, therefore donors are entitled to suitable compensation for their time spent and efforts made. Finally, we will explain that a reasonable compensation consisting of these two components allows for altruism to remain the key value of oocyte donation for reproductive treatment. However, if we acknowledge that donors' motives are more complex and often include reasons from self-interest, the reasonable compensation may be complemented with modest (non)monetary benefits.;;Kool E, van der Graaf R, Bos A, Fauser B, Bredenoord A;;eng;['Altruism', 'Biomedical Research/*economics/ethics', 'Humans', 'Motivation', 'Oocyte Donation/*economics/ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics/ethics', '*Remuneration'];['*donation/procurement of organs/tissues', '*ethics', '*reproductive medicine'];Competing interests: AMEB and BCJMF are the initiators of the UMC Utrecht oocyte  bank.

Drawing on a recent National Academy of Medicine report,  this review describes how such studies implicate the welfare of at least four different types of individuals who would not be considered human subjects under current regulations.

This distinction is ethically relevant for the design and justification of clinical trials. The relative stringency of the ethical duty to avoid harm makes it more important, all other things being equal, to avoid harms rather than avoid reduction of benefits. This is especially ethically important as it is often difficult to identify research non-participants who will suffer health harms due to research,  let alone obtain their informed consent. In these difficult cases, all other things being equal, we have ethical reason to prefer clinical trials that only reduce non-participants' health benefits to those that only involve harms to non-participants' health. When such trials are not feasible and we are unable to  get consent for the significant harms to research non-participants, these (and other) countervailing considerations must be outweighed by substantial social benefits in order for the trial to be ethically justified. Ethical research design must not just be concerned with the magnitude of adverse health effects on research non-participants but also the types of those effects.;;Vong G;;eng;['Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Ethics, Research', 'HIV Infections/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Insecticide-Treated Bednets', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Risk Assessment', 'Therapeutic Human Experimentation/*ethics'];['*Harm', '*bystanders', '*research ethics'];;R01 AI114617/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States;10.1177/1740774519867323
1768;31356577;Article;2019;Transplantation;;International Travel for Living Donor Kidney Donation: A Proposal for Focused Screening of Vulnerable Groups.;;As the gap between organ donors and patients on the recipient waiting list grows, residents of the United States who are in need of kidney transplantation occasionally contract with living donors from outside the United States. Those donors then travel to the United States to undergo living donor kidney donation at US transplant centers. This practice is not limited to the United States and occurs with some regularity around the world. However, there is very little written about this practice from the perspective of the US transplant system, and there is little in the way of guidance (either legal or ethical) to assist centers that accommodate it in distinguishing between ethically permissible travel for transplant and what could potentially be human trafficking for organ removal. This article will present an ethical analysis of travel for organ donation with particular attention to lessons that can be drawn from living donor donation in other countries. This inquiry is particularly germane because Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network has promulgated guidelines with respect to obligations owed to living donors, but those guidelines appear to assume that  the donor is a US resident. The critical question then is whether or to what extent those guidelines are applicable to the instant scenario in which the living donor is a nonresident. In addition, this article addresses several critical ethical concerns implicated by the often vulnerable populations from which donors are drawn. Finally, this article proposes that focused inquiry by transplant centers is necessary when donors are nonresidents.;;Hartsock JA, Helft PR;;eng;['*Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*standards', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', '*Travel', 'United States', '*Waiting Lists'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000002875

Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) policy safeguards were promulgated in the context of deceased donation, with its narrow time window for organ utilization and uncertainty about donor history. These policies have been applied to living donation without substantive data on risk of disease transmission in living donor transplantation. Unlike for deceased donors, the OPTN does not collect data on living donor IR status. Given the feasibility of thorough living donor evaluation via already-mandated lab tests and clinical assessments, living donor IR assessment and associated disclosures may have limited benefit in improving recipient informed consent. Applying the current IR policy to living donors may also introduce unintended consequences to donors and recipients, causing donors psychological harm, delays in donation to avoid IR status disclosure, and potential withdrawal from donation. We suggest strategies that reduce risk of harm to donor candidates while maintaining policy compliance, and review additional approaches for evaluating risk of disease transmission in living donor candidates.

Currently, there are no Canadian guidelines for the provision of organ transplantation for FNs, and no empirical data on this issue or on transplant professionals' practices are available. Objective: This project aimed to gather empirical data on transplant professionals' perspectives and practices regarding transplantation for FNs. Design: Survey research design. Setting: A Web-based survey of members of the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST). Participants: All members of the CST were invited to participate between April and June 2016. Measurements: Multiple-choice questions were developed to capture participants' attitudes toward different fictitious clinical scenarios in which an FN needed a transplant, their experiences with FNs, their attitude toward FNs in need of transplantation, their knowledge about relevant institutional and organ donation  organization (ODO) policies, and their perspectives on a quota. There were two questions with a five-point Likert scale to measure respondents' agreement with statements related to possible policy options and arguments for and against transplantation for FNs. There was one open-ended question about the content of transplant programs' policies on transplantation for FNs. Methods: Descriptive statistical analysis were performed. Results: A total of 87 transplant professionals completed the survey. Over the 4-year period from 2012 to 2016, 47.1% of respondents dealt with at least one situation of listing or performing a transplant for an FN. Only 19.5% of respondents reported that their transplant program had a policy about transplantation for FNs and 59.7% did not know if their ODO had such a policy. When asked about policy options, 47.5% disagreed with a policy of no transplantation for FNs and 41.4% agreed with offering transplantation for FNs in some circumstances (including life-saving and non-life-saving organs). Study participants agreed that transplantation should not be offered to FNs traveling to Canada specifically for transplantation, that  FNs should not be transplanted with organs not suitable for Canadian citizens and that there should not be a transplantation quota for FNs. Participants also seem  to be more inclined to offer transplantation of life-saving organs, particularly  for children. Limitations: The major limitation of this study is the low response rate of transplant professionals to this survey. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe Canadian transplant professionals' perspectives on transplantation for FNs. The findings of this study will be of interest for future policy development on access to transplantation for FNs. Further studies are needed to gather various key stakeholders' perspectives on this issue, as well as to analyze the legal and ethical issues and the economics, to develop future policies.;;Greenberg R, Ballesteros-Gallego F, Allard J, Fortin MC;;eng;;['medical ethics', 'survey', 'transplantation'];Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.;;10.1177/2054358119859530

The self-inflicted nature of this injury raises questions about the appropriate role of self-harm in determining patient eligibility. Potential candidates for facial transplantation undergo extensive psychosocial screening. The presence of a self-inflicted gunshot wound warrants special attention to ensure that a patient is prepared to undergo a demanding procedure that poses significant risk, as well as stringent lifelong management. Herein, we explore the ethics of considering mechanism of injury in the patient selection process, referring to the precedent set forth in solid organ transplantation. We also consider the available evidence regarding outcomes of individuals transplanted for self-inflicted mechanisms of injury in both solid organ and facial transplantation. We conclude that while the presence of a self-inflicted gunshot  wound is significant in the overall evaluation of the candidate, it does not on its own warrant exclusion from consideration for a facial transplantation.;;McQuinn MW, Kimberly LL, Parent B, Diaz-Siso JR, Caplan AL, Blitz AG, Rodriguez ED;;eng;['*Facial Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Patient Selection/*ethics', '*Self-Injurious Behavior', '*Wounds, Gunshot'];['*facial transplantation', '*patient selection', '*self-inflicted gunshot wound', '*transplant outcomes'];;;10.1017/S0963180119000379
1779;31298190;Article;2019;Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees;;Precision QALYs, Precisely Unjust.;;Warwick Heale has recently defended the notion of individualized and personalized Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in connection with health care resource allocation decisions. Ordinarily, QALYs are used to make allocation decisions at  the population level. If a health care intervention costs pound100,000 and generally yields only two years of survival, the cost per QALY gained will be pound50,000, far in excess of the pound30,000 limit per QALY judged an acceptable use of resources within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. However, if we know with medical certainty that a patient will gain four extra years of life from that intervention, the cost per QALY will be pound25,000. Heale argues fairness and social utility require such a patient to receive that treatment, even though all others in the cohort of that patient might be denied that treatment (and lose two years of potential life). Likewise, Heale argues that personal commitments of an individual (religious or otherwise), that determine how they value a life-year with some medical intervention, ought to be  used to determine the value of a QALY for them. I argue that if Heale's proposals were put into practice, the result would often be greater injustice. In brief, requirements for the just allocation of health care resources are more complex than pure cost-effectiveness analysis would allow.;;Fleck LM;;eng;['Advisory Committees', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decision Making/*ethics', 'England', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Heart Transplantation/economics', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics', 'Social Justice/*ethics', 'United States'];['*National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)', '*cost effectiveness', '*health care justice', '*individualized QALYs', '*personalized QALYs', '*targeted cancer therapies', '*utilitarianism'];;;10.1017/S0963180119000367
1780;31298097;Article;2019;The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics;;Geographic Location and Moral Arbitrariness in the Allocation of Donated Livers.;;The federal system for allocating donated livers in the United States is often criticized for allowing geographic disparities in access to livers. Critics argue that such disparities are unfair on the grounds that where one lives is morally arbitrary and so should not influence one's access to donated livers. They argue  instead that livers should be allocated in accordance with the equal opportunity  principle, according to which US residents who are equally sick should have the same opportunity to receive a liver, regardless of where they live. In this paper, we examine a central premise of the argument for the equal opportunity principle, namely, that geographic location is a morally arbitrary basis for allocating livers. We raise some serious doubts regarding the truth of this premise, arguing that under certain conditions, factors closely associated with geographic location are relevant to the allocation of livers, and so that candidates' geographic location is sometimes a morally non-arbitrary basis for allocating livers. Geographic location is morally non-arbitrary, we suggest, since by taking it into account, the UNOS may better fulfill its central goals of facilitating the effective and efficient placement of organs for transplantation  and increasing organ donation.;;MacKay D, Fitz S;;eng;['Adult', 'Health Policy/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Health Services Accessibility/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Healthcare Disparities/*ethics', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Morals', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Social Identification', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration', 'United States/epidemiology'];;;;10.1177/1073110519857287
1781;31297945;Article;2019;Pediatric transplantation;;Is there an ethical obligation to split every donor liver? Scarce resources, medical factors, and ethical reasoning.;;SLT has the potential to counter the worldwide shortage of donor organs. Although the preferred recipients of SLT are usually pediatric patients, a more stringent  ethical argument than the fundamental prioritization of children is to demonstrate that SLT of deceased donor organs could increase access to this potentially lifesaving resource for all patients, including children. Several empirical studies show that SLT also makes it possible to achieve similar outcomes to WLT in adults if several factors are observed. In general, it can be  regarded as ethically permissible to insist on splitting a donor liver if, in an  individual case, SLT is expected to have a similar outcome to that of WLT. The question is therefore no longer whether, but under what conditions SLT is able to achieve similar results to WLT. One of the main challenges of the current debate  is the restricted comparability of the available data. We therefore have an ethical obligation to improve the available empirical data by implementing prospective clinical studies, SLT programs, and national registries. The introduction of 2 modes of allocation-one for patients willing to accept both SLT and WLT, and a second for patients only willing to accept WLT-would help to resolve the issue of patient autonomy in the case of mandatory splitting policy.;;Bobbert M, Primc N, Schafer RN;;eng;['Germany', 'Graft Survival', 'Hepatectomy', 'Humans', 'Liver/surgery', 'Liver Failure/*surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Living Donors', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome'];['*deceased donor organ allocation', '*ethics', '*mandatory splitting policy', '*patient autonomy', '*prioritization of children', '*split liver transplantation'];;;10.1111/petr.13534

The aim of this study is to evaluate the organ procurement process in trauma-related injuries and determine the medical markers in organ donors and posttraumatic mortal patients at the first level emergency, in emergency surgical service, and surgical intensive care departments. METHODS: In this retrospective  study, after the approval of the ethics committee, the records of the patients in the emergency surgery unit, the operating room, and the organ donors in surgical  intensive care unit between the years 2000 January-2011 December were examined. Patient demographics, distribution of donated organs, intubation area, transfer to the hospital, patient's service, trauma type, injury mechanism, and severity of the injury were examined. Continuous variables were evaluated with independent samples by the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test and binary variables with  the Pearson Chi-Square test. The patients who lost their lives and survived in the emergency department (ED) were compared with an age ratio of 1: 3. Final results were evaluated by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The patients with </=90 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP) or penetrant serious injuries were  more likely to be candidates for organ donation in ED, respectively; 68.2% vs. 15.2% [AOR: 4.59 (1.14, 18.40), p<0.031] and 63.6% vs. 37.9% (AOR: 6.25 [1.27-30.49] [p<0.024]). Patients with AIS head >/=3 and in-hospital blood replacement of 1500 cc or more, were more likely to be organ donors after ED: 54.5% vs. 97% (AOR: 0.074 [0.014 kan0.548], [p<0.01]) and 10% vs. 58.1% (AOR: 0.098 [0.016-0.591], p<0.01]). CONCLUSION: In terms of predictive traits for organ procurement, a SBP of </=90 mmHg and presence of serious penetrant injuries were found to be more predictive for organ transplantation than other factors such as AIS Head >/=3 or 1500 cc or more replacement of blood and blood products.";;Albuz O;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Pressure/physiology', 'California', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Emergencies', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Operating Rooms', 'Replantation', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors/statistics & numerical data', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/statistics & numerical data', 'Wounds and Injuries/ethnology/*mortality/*surgery', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.14744/tjtes.2019.77250
1783;31283672;Article;2019;Transplantation;;Existing and Evolving Bioethical Dilemmas, Challenges, and Controversies in Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation: An International Perspective From the Brocher Bioethics Working Group.;;Early results of hand and face transplants and other grafts such as those of uterus, penis, trachea, larynx, or abdominal wall have confirmed the potential for vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) to restore appearance, anatomy, function, independence, and social integration in patients suffering from devastating tissue deficits untreatable by conventional treatment options. Despite such promise, these novel and complex procedures face challenges and controversies that remain open to discussion and debate. Indeed, many barriers to clinical advancement and negative stakeholder perceptions still exist. The bioethical challenges surrounding VCA include but are not limited to justice and  vulnerability of subjects, and their experiences with risks, benefits and outcomes, provider economy of fame, public awareness and attitudes toward transplantation, and policy and regulatory issues shaping progress of the field.  The First International Workshop on Bioethical Challenges in Reconstructive Transplantation was organized by the Brocher Foundation in Hermance, Switzerland. VCA professionals representing teams from across the world examined bioethical issues in VCA related to standards for safety, efficacy, feasibility, privacy, confidentiality, and equitability. Key discussion topics from the workshop were included in a survey questionnaire implemented across VCA professionals attending the 13th Congress of International Society of VCA held in Salzburg, Austria. The  insights from the Brocher workshop and International Society of VCA survey as presented here could help inform the future development of clinical practice and  policy strategies in VCA to ensure value, accessibility, and acceptance of these  procedures by potential donors, potential or actual recipients and their families, and providers and payers.;;Magill G, Benedict J, Plock JA, Krones T, Gorantla VS;;eng;['Clinical Decision-Making/*ethics', '*Composite Tissue Allografts', 'Confidentiality/*ethics', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', '*Patient Safety', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation/adverse effects/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000002606

Nevertheless, debates continue given numerous risks and lifelong immunosuppression. For many, face transplantation is still an experimental procedure, with unfinished philosophical and ethical explanations. This article aims to ascertain how identity features in the justification of facial allograft transplantation, and to critically investigate four neglected interpretations of identity. Firstly, the minimization of identity in transplantation of the vascular composite allograft. Second, the manipulation and management of identity in immunosuppression. Thirdly, how identity is de-centered in the exception of face  transplantation for the blind. Finally, how fading face recognition abilities cause identity to be compromised in psychological exclusions.

The role of ethics is critical in all aspects of medicine, but particularly so in the difficult and often challenging cases that arise in the care of pregnant women and newborns. One exemplary situation is that when a pregnant woman and her partner consider neonatal organ donation after receiving news of a terminal diagnosis and expected death of the newborn. While a newer, less practiced form of organ donation, this approach is gaining greater visibility as an option for parents facing this terminal outcome.

METHODS: From July 2015 to May 2016, 263 adults (among them 31 physicians and 20 nurses) judged the acceptability of living organ donation in 42 realistic scenarios composed of varying levels of 6 factors: 1. type of organ, 2. whether it could have been obtained from a cadaver, 3. donor-recipient relationship, 4. donor's level of autonomy, 5. financial compensation, and 6. patients' level of responsibility for their illness. In all  scenarios, the patients were in need of either a kidney or liver transplantation. RESULTS: The ratings were subjected to cluster analysis and analyses of variance. Seven qualitatively different positions were found that were termed never acceptable (12%), free market (44%), compensation (12%), altruism (6%), always acceptable (16%), responsibility (4%), and undetermined (6%). Physicians were more frequently in the free market or in the compensation clusters (81%) than laypeople (51%). CONCLUSION: Only a few participants held the altruism model, even though this model has been promoted as the normative model by the World Health Organization and by most national legislations, including the legislation  in Romania.

Ethical issues in face transplantation abound, including questions of patient selection and evaluation before transplantation. To date, there has been no study of ethicists' opinions regarding face transplantation. METHODS: An online survey of attendees of the 2015 International Conference on Clinical Ethics Consultation (n = 401) assessed ethicists' opinions about face transplantation. Questions examined the risk-to-benefit ratio of immunosuppression; permissibility of face transplantation in subpopulations (including children and blind patients); donor-recipient age, sex, and ethnicity  mismatches; and ethical oversight. RESULTS: Most ethicists (84 percent) agreed that it is permissible to perform a face transplantation on an adult in the absence of clear medical contraindications. Most respondents also agreed that it  is permissible to perform a face transplantation on a child (62 percent) or a blind patient (61 percent), yet demonstrated less consensus regarding the permissibility of performing a face transplantation on patients with an increased risk of immune rejection. Respondents were generally supportive of age, sex, and  ethnicity mismatches, with 43 percent indicating that it is permissible to have a sex mismatch. The majority answered that face transplantation should be covered by federal insurance (74 percent). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into  clinical ethicists' views regarding face transplantation. Most ethicists support  the ethical permissibility of face transplantation, and did not have concerns about age, sex, and ethnicity mismatches.

This study protocol describes the Donation Network to Optimise Organ Recovery Study, a planned cluster randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist for brain-dead potential organ donor management in intensive care units (ICUs) in reducing the loss of potential donors due to cardiac arrest. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will include ICUs of at least 60  Brazilian sites with an average of >/=10 annual notifications of valid potential  organ donors. Hospitals will be randomly assigned (with a 1:1 allocation ratio) to the intervention group, which will involve the implementation of an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist for potential organ donor maintenance, or the control group, which will maintain the usual care practices of the ICU. Team  members from all participating ICUs will receive training on how to conduct family interviews for organ donation. The primary outcome will be loss of potential donors due to cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes will include the number of actual organ donors and the number of organs recovered per actual donor. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The institutional review board (IRB) of the coordinating centre and of each participating site individually approved the study.

Embodiment, life stories and acquired facial 'disfigurement'.;;"Questions about the relationship between faces, 'disfigurement' and identity intensified following the first facial transplant (2005). Over a decade later, empirical research exploring the influence of acquired facial 'disfigurement' on  embodied identity disruption and re-formation remains limited. A common strand of thinking assumes identities are contained within faces. Commentators have suggested that identities can be diminished through 'disfigurement' and restored  or replaced through reconstruction or transplantation. The authors question this  claim and provide a conceptually informed, empirical alternative drawing on the results of a phenomenologically located, narrative study exploring identity shift in British adults following acquired 'disfigurement'. Findings suggest that faces are important to humans and that identities can be disrupted in the aftermath of  facial 'disfigurement'. Though, the relationship is not simple and cannot be predicted by the degree of corporeal change. Disrupted, liminal and contradictory strands of identity emerged; pre-existing identities were strengthened, new ones  emerged, and other non-related experiences were also influential. Nuanced relationality was at the heart of participant sense-making. Consequently, the authors reject the idea that identities are contained within faces and call for the development of a wider social and relational facial phenomenology to more comprehensively explore this fascinating, multifaceted relationship.";;Martindale AM, Fisher P;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Image', 'Face/*surgery', 'Facial Transplantation/*ethics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Narration', '*Self Concept', 'United Kingdom'];['*biographical disruption', '*embodiment', '*identity', '*narrative method', '*organ', '*phenomenology', '*transplants'];;;10.1111/1467-9566.12973

1794;31237243;Article;2019;JMIR research protocols;;Web-Based Self-Management Guide for Kidney Transplant Recipients (The Getting on  With Your Life With a Transplanted Kidney Study): Protocol for Development and Preliminary Testing.;;BACKGROUND: Although it is well known that compared with dialysis, kidney transplantation improves the quality of life (QoL) of patients with end-stage renal disease, posttransplant recovery of physical health and other aspects of QoL remain well below age- and sex-matched norms. In addition, most transplant recipients are not physically active even years after the transplant and face several barriers to engaging in physical activity (PA). This is of concern as low levels of PA in transplant recipients has been associated with increased risk of  mortality and poor graft function. Optimization of QoL needs a team approach involving the patients and the members of the health care team. While members of  the health care team are focused on optimizing the biological responses to transplant, patients may have few or no tools at their disposal to engage in behaviors that optimize QoL. To accomplish the need of supporting these patients  in the self-management of their condition and to facilitate engagement with PA, new tools tailored to this population are required. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this protocol study is to develop a Web-based, patient-centered self-management intervention to promote a healthy lifestyle, increase daily PA, and improve QoL in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We will use the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials model for developing behavioral treatments for chronic diseases to guide the proposed project. We will follow a modified version of the iterative 10-step process that was used to develop educational material for people with multiple sclerosis. The development of the intervention will occur in partnership with patients and a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers. A comprehensive needs assessment including data from our pilot study, literature review, and focus groups will be conducted. The focus groups will be conducted with 6 to 10 participants for each type of stakeholders: patients and professional experts to identify areas of concerns of kidney transplant recipients that are appropriate to address through self-management. The areas of concern identified through the assessment needs will be included in  the website. RESULTS: This study has received funding from the Kidney Foundation  of Canada for 2 years (2018-2020) and was recently granted ethics approval. Investigators have begun conducting the needs assessment described in step 1 of the study. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This will be the first comprehensive, evidence- and experience-based self-management program for kidney transplant recipients. Once the intervention is developed, we anticipate improvements in patient experience, shared decision making, daily PA, QoL, and, in future studies, improvements in health outcomes and demonstrations of cost savings in posttransplant care.

The views of international transplant professionals.;;Although live kidney donation (LD) has become an increasingly common procedure, European and US transplant centres disagree as to whether minors and young adults should qualify as donor candidates. Therefore, we aimed to better understand the  attitudes and viewpoints of transplant professionals. We conducted fourteen in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of international transplant professionals from various professional backgrounds. Data analysis was guided by  QUAGOL, a systematic approach based on the constant-comparative method. Professionals expressed a cautionary view, worrying about the uncertain long-term medical and psychosocial consequences of LD at a young age. They also worried that young individuals' decisions are more likely to be influenced by their psychosocial developmental stage or family pressure. As these concerns were more  significant for minors as compared to young adults, minors were deemed ineligible for LD except for in highly exceptional circumstances.

Liver transplantation for terminal liver failure due to excessive alcohol intake raises clear ethical issues concerning the use of grafts to save patients suffering from a self-inflecting affection. Alcoholic liver disease is one of the best indications for liver transplantation, with excellent results in terms of length of survival and post transplantation quality of life, if this transplantation is proposed by a multidisciplinary team in a patient able to and helped by a supporting family and social environment.;;Detry O, Meurisse N, Lamproye A, Warling O, Oger AF, Delwaide J, Honore P;;fre;['Adult', '*Alcoholism', 'Belgium', 'Humans', '*Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic/surgery', '*Liver Diseases, Alcoholic', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Quality of Life', 'Recurrence'];['* Cirrhosis', '* Complications', '* Ethics', '* Liver transplantation', '*Alcohol'];;;
1800;31199941;Article;2019;Journal of hepatology;;Allocation of liver grafts worldwide - Is there a best system?;;BACKGROUND & AIMS: An optimal allocation system for scarce resources should simultaneously ensure maximal utility, but also equity. The most frequent principles for allocation policies in liver transplantation are therefore criteria that rely on pre-transplant survival (sickest first policy), post-transplant survival (utility), or on their combination (benefit). However, large differences exist between centers and countries for ethical and legislative reasons. The aim of this study was to report the current worldwide practice of liver graft allocation and discuss respective advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: Countries around the world that perform 95 or more deceased donor liver  transplantations per year were analyzed for donation and allocation policies, as  well as recipient characteristics. RESULTS: Most countries use the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, or variations of it, for organ allocation,  while some countries opt for center-based allocation systems based on their specific requirements, and some countries combine both a MELD and center-based approach. Both the MELD and center-specific allocation systems have inherent limitations. For example, most countries or allocation systems address the limitations of the MELD system by adding extra points to recipient's laboratory scores based on clinical information. It is also clear from this study that cancer, as an indication for liver transplantation, requires special attention. CONCLUSION: The sickest first policy is the most reasonable basis for the allocation of liver grafts. While MELD is currently the standard for this model,  many adjustments were implemented in most countries. A future globally applicable strategy should combine donor and recipient factors, predicting probability of death on the waiting list, post-transplant survival and morbidity, and perhaps costs. LAY SUMMARY: An optimal allocation system for scarce resources should simultaneously ensure maximal utility, but also equity.

Yet crossing the species barrier has always been seen as potentially morally problematic. In recent years, advances in chimeric research and the attendant possibilities-organ xenotransplantation, cognitive enhancement, and others-have given rise to further ethical concern. This contribution surveys the main ethical questions that have been discussed in the literature. We examine two arguments-from the order of nature and from human dignity-which aim to show that chimerization is inherently  wrong. Finding the first untenable and the second largely inapplicable, we then turn to two unconvincing arguments designed to show that chimerization must necessarily lead to negative outcomes. Having thus found that no blanket statements can be made on the ethics of chimerization, we examine two important parameters relevant to the ethical evaluation of proposed chimeric research: the  argument from moral status and from risk.;;Mann SP, Sun R, Hermeren G;;eng;['Animal Experimentation/*ethics', 'Animals', '*Chimera', '*Ethics, Research', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics'];['*Chimera', '*Chimeric ethics', '*Framework', '*Moral', '*Xenobarrier'];;;10.1007/978-1-4939-9524-0_12

In this study, the endovascular puncture method was used to produce a rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Then, 30 minutes later, vascular endothelial growth factor A antagonist anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antibody,  10 mug, was injected into the right ventricle. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assay were used to assess expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A, occludin and claudin-5. Immunohistochemical double labeling was conducted to examine co-expression of GP Ia-II integrin and type IV collagen. TUNEL was used to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus. Neurological score was used to assess behavioral performance. After subarachnoid hemorrhage, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A increased in the hippocampus, while occludin and claudin-5 expression levels decreased. Co-expression of GP Ia-II integrin and type IV collagen and the number of apoptotic cells increased, whereas behavioral  performance was markedly impaired. After treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antibody, occludin and claudin-5 expression recovered, while co-expression of GP Ia-II integrin and type IV collagen and the number of apoptotic cells decreased. Furthermore, behavioral performance improved notably.  Our findings suggest that increased vascular endothelial growth factor A levels promote platelet adhesion and contribute to early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage.

De novo donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (dnDSA), are key biomarkers associated with reduced long-term allograft survival, yet there is a lack of data focusing on age-associated changes. Methods: Development of dnDSA was restrospectively analyzed in all subjects who received a kidney transplant at the University Hospital Zurich between 01/2006 and 02/2015. Follow up continued until 03/2016. The incidence of dnDSA in different age categories was compared with special focus on the extremes of age: children < 10 years (n = 19) and adults >/=60 years of age (n = 110). Results: Incidence of dnDSA gradually decreased with age, with  older recipients having a significantly lower risk (HR 0.21, p = 0.0224) compared to pediatric recipients. Cumulative incidence of dnDSA at 2, 5 and 10 years was 6.2, 9.1 and 36% in the older recipients versus 5.3, 29.5 and 47.1% in pediatric  recipients. Median time to development of dnDSA was similar (older 720 days, min  356, max 3646 days; children 1086 days, min 42, max 2474 days). Annual incidence  was highest within the first two years after transplantation in the older recipients and peaked in years two to four in pediatric recipients. DnDSA were predominantly class II. More dnDSA were observed with cyclosporine as compared to tacrolimus. Conclusion: Older kidney transplant recipients have a lower risk of developing dnDSA than pediatric recipients, pointing towards reduced humoral immune reactivity with increasing age.

METHOD: This is a qualitative study that uses social phenomenology as the theoretical reference, interviewing 8 family members of deceased potential donors. RESULTS: The family members' experiences were represented by the following categories: beliefs related to donation, fear in the face of the loved one's death, and the ethical dilemma of deciding to refuse the  donation. The meaning of the refusal to donate was represented by the following categories: respect for the loved one's wishes and the family's peace of mind with the decision.

Split LT (SLT) increases organ utilization, saving 2 recipients. A simulation of Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing data (2007-2017) was performed to identify whole-organ LT grafts (WLT) that met the criteria for being splittable to 2 recipients. Waitlist consequences presented. Deceased donor (DD) livers transplanted as whole organs were evaluated for suitability to split. Of these DD organs, we identified the adolescent and adult  recipients of WLT who were suitable for SLT. Pediatric candidates suitable to share the SLT were ascertained from DD match-run lists, and 1342 splittable DD organs were identified; 438 WLT recipients met the criteria for accepting a SLT.  Review of the 438 DD match-run lists identified 420 children next on the list suitable for SLT. Three hundred thirty-three children (79%) underwent LT, but had longer wait-times compared to 591 actual pediatric SLT recipients (median 147 days vs 44 days, P < 0.001). Thirty-three of 420 children died on waitlist after  a mean 206 days (standard deviation 317). Sharing organs suitable for splitting increases the number of LT, saving more lives.

This study assessed African American (AA) donors' perceptions of APOL1 genetic testing and how APOL1 may affect ethnic identity. METHODS/APPROACH: Four focus groups were conducted with AA donors about their decision-making for and perceptions of APOL1 genetic testing and donation to inform a new culturally  targeted educational brochure on APOL1 genetic testing. Qualitative data were analyzed by thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Seventeen donors participated (47% participation rate). Four major themes emerged. (1) In hypothetical scenarios, most participants would have undergone APOL1 testing during donor evaluation to make a more informed decision, but many would have still donated. (2) Participants desired information about how having 2 APOL1 risk variants affects the donor's and the recipient's health. (3) Participants referred to diversity of genetic ancestry and cultural constructions of racial/ethnic identity to question the population at risk for APOL1 risk variants and recommended that all potential donors undergo genetic testing and receive education about APOL1. (4) Participants worried that out-of-pocket costs would deter APOL1 testing and that  APOL1 could become a preexisting condition and discriminate against AAs. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that AA donors desire APOL1 testing to foster informed consent.

Currently, these transplants must adhere to the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act Safeguards and Research Criteria that require the provision of an independent recipient advocate, a novel requirement for solid organ transplant programs. The objective of this study was to understand the experiences of the first advocates serving in this role. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 HOPE independent recipient advocates (HIRAs) from 12 institutions. RESULTS: All HIRAs had a professional degree and experience in transplantation or infectious diseases. HIRAs' encounters with potential recipients varied in length, modality, and timing. The newness of the role and the lack of guidance were associated with unease among some HIRAs. Some questioned whether their role was redundant to others involved in transplantation and research since some potential recipients experienced informational fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: HOPE independent recipient advocates are ensuring the voluntariness  of potential participants' decision to accept an HIV-infected organ. Many suggested additional guidance would be helpful and alleviate unease.

In this sense, the notion of person is important due to its multiplicity of possible interpretations depending on its cultural context. This  fact is highlighted in the case of organ transplantation in Japan. While there are many critiques against this procedure from scholars in various fields, those  that deal with the problem of brain death are especially problematic. This is because the definition of person that is invoked in such debates does not seem to coincide with how the notion of person has been understood in the Japanese tradition. Hence, investigating the Japanese concept of ningen could be helpful in not only partially clarifying some of the attitudes that exist in Japan towards the notion of brain death, but also to illustrate the need to recognize the plurality of views in modern bioethics.;;Canamero EH;;eng;['*Attitude to Death', 'Brain Death/*diagnosis/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Buddhism', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Organ Transplantation/history/legislation & jurisprudence/*psychology', '*Personhood', 'Social Values', 'Tissue Donors/psychology'];['Japan', 'Person', 'brain death', 'ningen', 'organ transplantation'];;;10.1080/20502877.2019.1613809

In this study we describe 2 cases of successful adult DCD HT performed at our institution using an original protocol. METHODS: Our local abdominal DCD protocol was updated to allow DCD heart procurement, and was  accepted by the institutional ethics committee. The main features of the protocol include: pre-mortem insertion of peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane  oxygenation cannulas; thoracoabdominal normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) by clamping the 3 aortic arch vessels to exclude cerebral circulation; and in-situ heart resuscitation. The retrieved hearts were directly transplanted into recipients located in an adjoining operating room. RESULTS: The procurement warm  ischemic time was 25 minutes for the first donor, and 26 minutes for the second donor. The cold ischemic time was 16 minutes for the first recipient and 17 minutes for the second recipient. The suture time was 30 minutes for the first recipient, and 53 minutes for the second recipient. Both recipients were easily weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass in sinus rhythm and inotropic support. Post-operative evaluation of cardiac function was excellent and the patients were subsequently discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of hearts from DCD donors is now a clinical reality.NRP is a useful tool for resuscitation, reperfusion, and preservation of transplanted hearts.

As more patients adopt this unconventional therapy, it is inevitable that potential transplant recipients will disclose their cannabis use during transplant evaluation. Transplant teams are tasked with the decision to utilize a pressure resource, often with little guidance from international and national professional organizations. Many healthcare providers remain uniformed or misinformed about the risks of cannabis use and organ transplantation. In order to illustrate the multifaceted and complex evaluation of transplant patients using medical cannabis, this article presents the case of a 20-year-old woman recommended for renal transplant who was originally denied active listing due to her medical cannabis use.

1818;31111619;Article;2019;Journal of viral hepatitis;;Use of HCV-infected organs in solid organ transplantation: An ethical challenge but plausible option.;;Due to the unfortunate epidemic of opioid overdose deaths among people who inject drugs (PWID) in North America, there has been an increase in the availability of  hepatitis C (HCV)-positive organs for transplantation and consequently the potential to decrease waiting times for solid organ transplantation if an HCV-uninfected recipient is willing to accept an HCV-positive donor. The confidence in this potential new strategy comes as a result of the advent of safe and highly effective pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). This promising strategy has been the most widely studied in kidney transplantation. Liver transplantation has positive results preliminarily, but has even less available data because viable HCV-infected donor livers are typically transplanted into HCV-infected individuals. Further, while HCV-infected heart and lung transplantation, which face additional post-transplant issues, have shown encouraging results, these studies are small scale and are limited by short-term  follow-up. Thus, it would be premature to implement this strategy as standard of  care without large scale clinical and real-world trials and longer-term follow-up studies. Further, the ethics of this practice need to be considered. While some transplant professionals argue that more harm will be done by not utilizing HCV-infected organs, others contend that cautiously conducted multi-centre studies involving extensive post-transplant follow-up are paramount prior to endorsing widespread implementation of this strategy. The ethical permissibility  of this practice hinges on whether access to DAA therapy can be secured in advance, and prospective recipients understand and accept all the risks associated with acquiring HCV.;;Nangia G, Borges K, Reddy KR;;eng;['*Ethics, Professional', 'Heart Transplantation', '*Hepacivirus', 'Hepatitis C/diagnosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/diagnosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Organ Transplantation/adverse effects/*ethics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', '*Tissue Donors'];['*DAA therapy', '*HCV-infected organs', '*transplantation'];;;10.1111/jvh.13130

To better characterize this variability, we performed a survey of psychosocial listing criteria for pediatric and adult heart, lung, liver, and kidney programs in the USA. In this manuscript, we report our results  regarding listing practices with respect to obesity, advanced age, and HIV seropositivity. METHODS: We performed an online, forced-choice survey of adult and pediatric heart, kidney, liver, and lung transplant programs in the USA. RESULTS: Of 650 programs contacted, 343 submitted complete responses (response rate = 52.8%). Most programs have absolute contraindications to listing for BMI > 45 (adult: 67.5%; pediatric: 88.0%) and age > 80 (adult: 55.4%; pediatric: not relevant). Only 29.5% of adult programs and 25.7% of pediatric programs consider  HIV seropositivity an absolute contraindication to listing. We found that there is variation in absolute contraindications to listing in adult programs among organ types for BMI > 45 (heart 89.8%, lung 92.3%, liver 49.1%, kidney 71.9%), age > 80 (heart 83.7%, lung 76.9%, liver 68.4%, kidney 29.2%), and HIV seropositivity (heart 30.6%, lung 59.0%, kidney 16.9%, liver 28.1%). CONCLUSIONS: We argue that variability in listing enhances access to transplantation for potential recipients who have the ability to pursue workup at different centers by allowing different programs to have different risk thresholds. Programs should remain independent in listing practices, but because these practices differ, we recommend transparency in listing policies and informing patients of reasons for  listing denial and alternative opportunities to seek listing at another program.";;Wall A, Lee GH, Maldonado J, Magnus D;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', '*Contraindications', 'Female', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Waiting Lists', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1007/s00268-019-05030-x

Before and after this event, ethical aspects of UTx-IVF have been discussed in the medical and bioethical debate as well as, with varying intensity, in Swedish media and political fora. This article examines what comes  to be identified as important ethical problems and solutions in the media debate  of UTx-IVF in Sweden, showing specifically how problems, target groups, goals, benefits, risks and stakes are delineated and positioned. It also demonstrates how specific assumptions, norms and values are expressed and used to underpin specific positions within this debate, and how certain subjects, desires and risks become shrouded or simply omitted from it. This approach-which we label the Ethics of the Societal Entrenchment-approach, inspired by Koch and Stemerding (1994)-allows us to discuss how the identification of something as the problem helps to shape what gets to be described as a solution, and how specific solutions provide frameworks within which problems can be stated and emphasised.  We also offer a critical discussion of whether some of these articulations and formations should be seen as ethically troubling, and if so, why.;;Guntram L, Zeiler K;;eng;['Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro/*ethics/methods', 'Humans', 'Inventions/*ethics', 'Parents', 'Parturition', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sweden', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics', 'Uterus/*transplantation'];['Discourse', 'Empirical ethics', 'Ethical problems', 'Societal entrenchment', 'Surrogacy', 'Uterus transplantation'];;SCASS Pro Futura Scientia Fellowship/Riksbankens Jubileumsfond;10.1007/s11019-019-09891-w

1822;31092629;Article;2019;Journal of medical ethics;;Waiting for a miracle or best medical practice? End-of-life medical ethical dilemmas in Bahrain.;;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In Bahrain, maintaining life support at all costs is a cultural value considered to be embedded in the Islamic religion. We explore end-of-life decision making for brain dead patients in an Arab country where medical cultures are dominated by Western ideas and the lay culture is Eastern. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted from February to April 2018 with 12 Western-educated Bahraini doctors whose medical practice often included end-of-life decision making. Discussions were about who should make withdrawal of life support decisions, how decisions are made and the context for decision making. To develop results, we used the inductive method of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Informants considered it difficult to engage non-medical people in end-of-life decisions because of people's reluctance to talk about death and no legal clarity about medical responsibilities. There was disagreement about doctors' roles with some saying that end-of-life decisions were purely medical or purely religious but most maintaining that such decisions need to be collectively owned by medicine, patients, families, religious advisors and society. Informants practised in a legal vacuum that made their ethics interpretations and clinical decision making idiosyncratic regarding end-of-life care for brain dead patients. Participants referred to contrasts between their current practice and previous work in other countries, recognising the influences of religious and cultural dimensions on their practice in Bahrain. CONCLUSIONS: End-of-life decisions challenge Western-trained doctors in Bahrain as they grapple with aligning respect for local culture with their training in the ethical practice of Western  medicine.;;Alwadaei S, Almoosawi B, Humaidan H, Dovey S;;eng;['Bahrain', 'Clinical Decision-Making/ethics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Islam', 'Life Support Care/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Terminal Care/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Withholding Treatment/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence'];['*ethics', '*legal aspects', '*moral and religious aspects', '*palliative care', '*religious ethics'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2018-105297
1823;31090649;Article;2019;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Uncontrolled donation after circulatory death: ethics of implementation.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite its potential to increase the donor pool, uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) is available in a limited number of countries. Ethical concerns may preclude the expansion of this program. This article addresses the ethical concerns that arise in the implementation of uDCD.  RECENT FINDINGS: The first ethical concern is that associated with the determination of an irreversible cardiac arrest. Professionals must strictly adhere to local protocols and international standards on advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, independent of their participation in an uDCD program. Cardiac compression and mechanical ventilation are extended beyond futility during the transportation of potential uDCD donors to the hospital with the sole purpose of  preserving organs. Importantly, potential donors remain monitored while being transferred to the hospital, which allows the identification of any return of spontaneous circulation. Moreover, this procedure allows the determination of death to be undertaken in the hospital by an independent health care provider who reassesses that no other therapeutic interventions are indicated and observes a period of the complete absence of circulation and respiration. Extracorporeal-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation programs can successfully coexist with uDCD programs. The use of normothermic regional perfusion with ECMO  devices for the in-situ preservation of organs is considered appropriate in a setting in which the brain is subject to profound and prolonged ischemic damage.  Finally, communication with relatives must be transparent and accurate, and the information should be provided respecting the time imposed by the family's needs  and emotions. SUMMARY: uDCD can help increase the availability of organs for transplantation while giving more patients the opportunity to donate organs after death. The procedures should be designed to confront the ethical challenges that  this practice poses and respect the values of all those involved.;;Molina M, Dominguez-Gil B, Perez-Villares JM, Andres A;;eng;['Brain Death/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Organ Preservation/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000648
1824;31085631;Article;2019;Journal of medical ethics;;Needs must: living donor liver transplantation from an HIV-positive mother to her HIV-negative child in Johannesburg, South Africa.;;"The world's first living donor liver transplant from an HIV-positive mother to her HIV-negative child, performed by our team in Johannesburg, South Africa (SA)  in 2017, was necessitated by disease profile and health system challenges. In our country, we have a major shortage of donor organs, which compels us to consider innovative solutions to save lives. Simultaneously, the transition of the HIV pandemic, from a death sentence to a chronic illness with excellent survival on treatment required us to rethink our policies regarding HIV infection and living  donor liver transplantation . Although HIV infection in the donor is internationally considered an absolute contraindication for transplant to an HIV-negative recipient, there have been a very small number of unintentional transplants from HIV-positive deceased donors to HIV-negative recipients. These transplant recipients do well on antiretroviral medication and their graft survival is not compromised. We have had a number of HIV-positive parents in our  setting express a desire to be living liver donors for their critically ill children. Declining these parents as living donors has become increasingly unjustifiable given the very small deceased donor pool in SA; and because many of these parents are virally suppressed and would otherwise fulfil our eligibility criteria as living donors. This paper discusses the evolution of HIV and transplantation in SA, highlights some of the primary ethical considerations for  us when embarking on this case and considers the new ethical issues that have arisen since we undertook this transplant.";;Etheredge HR, Fabian J, Duncan M, Conradie F, Tiemessen C, Botha J;;eng;['Adult', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Making, Shared', 'Donor Selection/*ethics', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', '*HIV Seropositivity/transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Diseases/*physiopathology/surgery', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics/methods', '*Living Donors', '*Mothers', 'Risk Assessment', 'South Africa', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics', 'Treatment Outcome'];['*HIV infection and aids', '*informed consent', '*regulation', '*surgery', '*transplantation'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2018-105216
1825;31079074;Article;2019;Archives of disease in childhood;;Parents' experiences of requests for organ and tissue donation: the value of asking.;;OBJECTIVE: A proportion of children die, making them potentially eligible to be organ/tissue donors. Not all are approached for donation, and experiences of those parents are not well understood. The objective was to investigate to what extent organ and tissue donation (OTD) is discussed as part of end-of-life care and to explore parents' and healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experiences. DESIGN: A retrospective qualitative study. SETTING: Multicentre study with participants recruited through two neonatal intensive care units (ICUs), two paediatric ICUs,  a cardiac ICU and a children's hospice. PATIENTS: Bereaved parents, parents of a  child with a long-term condition (LTC) and HCPs. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parents' and HCPs' views and experiences of discussions about OTD. RESULTS: 24 parents of 20 children were interviewed: 21 bereaved parents and 3 parents of a child with a LTC. Seven parents were asked about donation (13 not asked), four agreed and two donated. 41 HCPs were interviewed. Themes: complexity of donation process, OTD as a coping strategy, the importance  of asking, difficulty of raising the topic,\ and parents' assumptions about health of organs (when donation is not discussed). CONCLUSIONS: The findings add  new knowledge about parents' assumptions about the value of their child's organs  when discussions about OTD are not raised, and that HCPs do not routinely ask, are sometimes hesitant to ask in fear of damaging relationships, and the reality  of the complexity of the donation process. Given the current levels of awareness  around OTD, the topic should be raised.;;Darlington AS, Long-Sutehall T, Randall D, Wakefield C, Robinson V, Brierley J;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Grief', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Futility/ethics/*psychology', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/*psychology', 'Parents/education/*psychology', 'Professional-Family Relations/*ethics', 'Qualitative Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Terminal Care/ethics/*psychology', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['*organ donation', '*palliative care', '*parents', '*qualitative research'];Competing interests: None declared.;DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom;10.1136/archdischild-2018-316382

Ovarian tissue cryopreservation presents as an alternative but has limitations with a potential  risk of reintroducing malignant cells in patients who recover from cancer, those  of chemotherapy prior to tissue cryopreservation. The so called ""artificial ovary"" aims to resolve this issue by transplanting isolated follicles with or without a biological scaffold. The artificial ovary may also offer an effective alternative option for those who cannot benefit from traditional assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilisation. To date, in animal studies and human trial, the artificial ovary restored endocrine function, achieved in vivo follicular development, and resulted in successful pregnancies.  However, development of a technique for higher follicular recovery rate and a more optimised design of delivery scaffold, better transplantation techniques to  prevent postsurgical ischemia, and consideration for genetic safety are required  for safer and consistent human clinical applications. Ideas from different transplantation surgeries (e.g., entire ovary, ovarian cortex, and transplantation with tissue-engineered products) can be applied to enhance the efficacy of artificial ovarian transplantation. For the better application of artificial ovary, a deeper understanding of mechanical and biochemical properties of the ovary and folliculogenesis after cryopreservation, transplantation with or without scaffold, and development of sophisticated in vivo imaging techniques of  transplanted artificial ovary need to precede its efficient clinical application.";;Cho E, Kim YY, Noh K, Ku SY;;eng;['Animals', '*Artificial Organs/ethics', 'Female', '*Fertility Preservation/ethics', 'Humans', 'Organ Preservation', 'Ovary/*physiology', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry'];['*artificial ovary', '*cryopreservation', '*fertility preservation', '*scaffold', '*tissue engineering', '*transplantation'];;;10.1002/term.2870
1828;31058410;Article;2019;Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health  care and health policy;;Designing a co-productive study to overcome known methodological challenges in organ donation research with bereaved family members.;;BACKGROUND: Co-production of research into public health services has yet to demonstrate tangible benefits. Few studies have reported the impact of co-production on research outcomes. The previous studies of organ donation have identified challenges in engaging with public organizations responsible, gaining  ethical approval for sensitive studies with the recently bereaved and difficulty  in recruiting bereaved family members who were approached about organ donation. OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, we designed the first large co-productive observational study to evaluate implementation of a new system of organ donation  in Wales. This paper outlines the co-productive strategies that were designed to  overcome known methodological challenges and reports what impact they had on resolving these challenges. DESIGN: Two-year co-produced study with multiple stakeholders with the specific intention of maximizing engagement with the National Health Service arm in Wales responsible for organ donation, and recruitment of bereaved family members whose perspectives are essential but commonly absent from studies. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: NHS Blood and Transplant, Welsh Government and multiple patient and public representatives who served as co-productive partners with the research team. RESULTS: Co-productive strategies  enabled a smooth passage through four different ethics processes within the 10-week time frame, family member recruitment targets to be surpassed, sharing of routinely collected data on 100% of potential organ donor cases and development of further research capacity and capability in a critically under researched area.

The aim: To find out the problems of human organ transplantation and other anatomical materials and determine the directions of their solutions in Ukraine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The assessment and analysis of domestic and foreign experience has been developed. In addition, data collected from Ukrainian and international organizations and the results of scientific research by scientists  are used in the work. RESULTS: Review and conclusions: Investigating the legislation of Ukraine in the part of transplantation of human organs and other anatomical materials, conclusions were made on the necessity of its improvement,  in particular, Article 16 of the Law of Ukraine <<On the application of transplantation of anatomical materials to a person>> dated by May 17, 2018, is proposed to be worded as follows: <<Any adult may give written consent or disagreement to become a donor of anatomical materials in case of his death. In the absence of such a statement of disagreement with the transplantation of his organs or other anatomical materials, consent of relatives or others is not required. In this case, the deceased person is deemed to have given consent to the transplantation of his organs or other anatomical materials>>. It is proposed to make changes and significant additions to Art. 17 of the Law of Ukraine <<On the application of transplantation of anatomical materials to a person>> of May 17, 2018 regarding the creation of the Unified State Register of persons in need  of transplantation, as well as to consolidate the procedure for its administration. In the context of urgent transformations, the necessity to significantly increase state funding for the provision of medical services, raise the awareness and informality of citizens about transplantation, as well as to change their misconceptions about this issue are sometimes put forward.;;Krasmall i, Ukrainiannsmall u, Cyrillick capital EN, CyrillicS, Psmall o, Cyrillicsmall er, Cyrillicsmall o, Cyrillicva SM, Vakulovych EV;;eng;['Humans', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Ukraine'];['donor', 'presumption of consent for transplantation', 'transplantation'];;;
1831;31033855;Article;2019;Transplantation;;The Role of the Family in Deceased Organ Procurement: A Guide for Clinicians and  Policymakers.;;"Families play an essential role in deceased organ procurement. As the person cannot directly communicate his or her wishes regarding donation, the family is often the only source of information regarding consent or refusal. We provide a systematic description and analysis of the different roles the family can play, and actions the family can take, in the organ procurement process across different jurisdictions and consent systems. First, families can inform or update healthcare professionals about a person's donation wishes. Second, families can authorize organ procurement in the absence of deceased's preferences and the default is not to remove organs, and oppose donation where there is no evidence of preference but the default is to presume consent; in both cases, the decision  could be based on their own wishes or what they think the deceased would have wanted. Finally, families can overrule the known wishes of the deceased, which can mean preventing donation, or permitting donation when the deceased refused it. We propose a schema of 4 levels on which to map these possible family roles:  no role, witness, surrogate, and full decisional authority. We conclude by mapping different jurisdictions onto this schema to provide a more comprehensive  understanding of the consent system for organ donation and some important nuances about the role of families. This classificatory model aims to account for the majority of the world's consent systems. It provides conceptual and methodological guidance that can be useful to researchers, professionals, and policymakers involved in organ procurement.";;Delgado J, Molina-Perez A, Shaw D, Rodriguez-Arias D;;eng;['*Decision Making', '*Family', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Policy', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/legislation & jurisprudence/*standards'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000002622

Reflection upon the case resulted in analysis of two ethical questions: primarily, clinician obligation to balance the provision of actuarially fair health care to society against the healing of a single patient; secondarily, the effects of malleable transplant criteria on trust in the patient selection process. We affirmed that physicians should not be principally responsible for justifying financial investment to society or for upholding beneficence beyond the individual physician and patient relationship in order to contain costs.

1833;31020671;Article;2019;Bioethics;;Will more organs save more lives? Cost-effectiveness and the ethics of expanding  organ procurement.;;The assumption that procuring more organs will save more lives has inspired increasingly forceful calls to increase organ procurement. This project, in contrast, directly questions the premise that more organ transplantation means more lives saved. Its argument begins with the fact that resources are limited and medical procedures have opportunity costs. Because many other lifesaving interventions are more cost-effective than transplantation and compete with transplantation for a limited budget, spending on organ transplantation consumes  resources that could have been used to save a greater number of other lives. This argument has not yet been advanced in debates over expanded procurement and could buttress existing concerns about expanded procurement. To support this argument,  I review existing empirical data on the cost-effectiveness of transplantation and compare them to data on interventions for other illnesses. These data should motivate utilitarians and others whose primary goal is maximizing population-wide health benefits to doubt the merits of expanding organ procurement. I then consider two major objections: one makes the case that transplant candidates have a special claim to medical resources, and the other challenges the use of cost-effectiveness to set priorities. I argue that there is no reason to conclude that transplant candidates' medical interests should receive special priority, and that giving some consideration to cost-effectiveness in priority setting requires neither sweeping changes to overall health priorities nor the adoption of any specific, controversial metric for assessing cost-effectiveness. Before searching for more organs, we should first ensure the provision of cost-effective care.;;Persad G;;eng;['*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Ethical Theory', 'Health Priorities', 'Health Resources', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/*ethics'];['*John Taurek', '*consequentialism', '*cost-effectiveness', '*opportunity cost', '*organ procurement', '*organ transplantation', '*resource allocation'];;;10.1111/bioe.12587

Since the inception of these center metrics, 1-year posttransplant graft and patient survival have improved, and center variation has decreased, casting uncertainty on their clinical relevance. The SRTR has recently modified center evaluations by ranking centers into 5 tiers rather than 3 tiers in an attempt to discriminate between programs performing within a tight range, further exacerbating this uncertainty. The American Society of Transplantation/American Society of Transplant Surgeons convened an expert taskforce to examine both the utility and unintended consequences of transplant center metrics. Estimates of center variation in outcomes in adjacent tiers are imprecise and fleeting, but can result in consequential changes in clinician and center behavior. The taskforce has concerns that current metrics, based principally on 1-year graft and patient survival, provide minimal if any benefit in informing patient choice and access to transplantation, with the untoward effect of decreased utilization of organs and restriction of research and innovation.;;Chandraker A, Andreoni KA, Gaston RS, Gill J, Locke JE, Mathur AK, Norman DJ, Patzer RE, Rana A, Ratner LE, Schold JD, Pruett TL;;eng;['Humans', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Registries', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement', '*Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists'];['*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*patient education', '*registry/registry analysis'];;;10.1111/ajt.15394

Thus, careful decisions must be made about who is listed for transplant. Studies  show that manifesting genetic disease can impact listing eligibility. What has not yet been studied is the impact genetic risks for future disease have on a patient's chance to be listed. Surveys were emailed to 163 pediatric liver, heart, and kidney transplant programs across the United States to elicit views and experiences of key clinicians regarding each program's use of genetic risks (ie, predispositions, positive predictive testing) in listing decisions. Response rate was 42%. Sixty-four percent of programs have required genetic testing for specific indications prior to listing decisions. Sixteen percent have required it without specific indications, suggesting that genetic testing may be used to screen candidates. Six percent have chosen not to list patients with secondary findings or family histories of genetic conditions. In hypothetical scenarios, programs consider cancer predispositions and adult-onset neurological conditions  to be relative contraindications to listing (61%, 17%, and 8% depending on scenario), and some consider them absolute contraindications (5% and 3% depending on scenario). Only 3% of programs have formal policies for these scenarios, but all consult genetic specialists at least ""sometimes"" for results interpretation.

As genetic testing is increasingly adopted into pediatric medicine, further study is needed to prevent possible inappropriate use of genetic information from impacting listing eligibility.";;Graf M, Char D, Hanson-Kahn A, Magnus D;;eng;['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Child', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Progression', 'Exome', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genes, BRCA1', 'Genes, p53', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing', 'Genetic Variation', 'Heart Transplantation/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Huntington Disease/genetics', 'Internet', 'Kidney Transplantation/methods/standards', 'Liver Transplantation/methods/standards', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation/*methods/*standards', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics', '*Patient Selection', 'Pediatrics', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods/*standards', 'United States', '*Waiting Lists', 'Whole Genome Sequencing'];['*bioethics', '*contraindications', '*genetic predisposition testing', '*organ transplantation', '*pediatric transplantation', '*predictive genetic testing'];;K01 HG008498/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/petr.13402
1837;31008919;Article;2019;Transplantation;;Deceased Donor-initiated Chains: First Report of a Successful Deliberate Case and Its Ethical Implications.;;BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that deceased donor kidneys could be used to initiate chains of living donor kidney paired donation, but the potential gains of this practice need to be quantified and the ethical implications must be addressed before it can be implemented. METHODS: The gain of implementing deceased donor-initiated chains was measured with an algorithm, using retrospective data on the pool of incompatible donor/recipient pairs, at a single center. The allocation rules for chain-ending kidneys and the characteristics and quality of the chain-initiating kidney are described. RESULTS: The benefit quantification process showed that, with a pool of 69 kidneys from deceased donors and 16 pairs enrolled in the kidney paired donation program, it was possible to transplant 8 of 16 recipients (50%) over a period of 3 years. After obtaining the approval of the Veneto Regional Authority's Bioethical Committee and the revision of the Italian National Transplant Center's allocation policies, the first successful case was completed. For the recipient (male, aged 53 y), who entered the program for a chain-initiating kidney with a Kidney Donor Risk Index  of 0.61 and a Kidney Donor Profile Index of 3%, the waiting time was 4 days. His  willing donor (female, aged 53 y) with a Living Kidney Donor Profile Index of 2,  donated 2 days later to a chain-ending recipient (male, aged 47 y) who had been on dialysis for 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a successfully  completed, deliberate deceased donor-initiated chain, which was made possible after a thorough assessment of the ethical issues and the impact of allocation policies.

Inferior  allograft outcomes following transplantation with kidneys from donors with 2 risk variants have also been reported. These data, coupled with anecdotal case reports and a recent cohort study of living donors, raise important questions about the potential increased kidney disease risk for living donors with APOL1 risk variants and the need for testing as part of the standard living donor evaluation process. We identify a series of questions that are central to the development of clinical policy regarding APOL1 testing of potential living kidney donors given the current uncertainty over the clinical implications of having 2 risk variants. We explore the ethical challenges that arise when determining when and to whom APOL1 testing should be offered, what potential donors should be told about APOL1 testing, how test results should be used to determine suitability for donation, if and when recipients should have access to results, and how clinical policy regarding APOL1 testing should be established.;;Mohan S, Iltis AS, Sawinski D, DuBois JM;;eng;['Apolipoprotein L1/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/ethics/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/diagnosis/*genetics/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/ethics/*methods/standards', '*Living Donors/ethics'];['*APOL1', '*allograft survival', '*apolipoprotein L1', '*end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', '*ethics', '*genetic testing', '*kidney transplant', '*living donors', '*organ donation', '*racial disparities', '*risk variant'];;R01 DK114893/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1053/j.ajkd.2019.02.007

Deceased organ donors are classified as ""increased risk"" if they engaged in specific behaviors during the 12 months before death. We developed a model to estimate the risk of undetected infection for HIV, HBV, and HCV among NAT-negative donors specific to the type and timing of donors' potential risk behavior to guide revisions to the 12-month  timeline. Model parameters were estimated, including risk of disease acquisition  for increased risk groups, number of virions that multiply to establish infection, virus doubling time, and limit of detection by NAT. Monte Carlo simulation was performed. The risk of undetected infection was <1/1 000 000 for HIV after 14 days, for HBV after 35 days, and for HCV after 7 days from the time  of most recent potential exposure to the day of a negative NAT.

In all  scenarios, the patients were in need of a kidney or liver transplantation. The ratings were subjected to cluster analysis and analyses of variance. RESULTS: Five qualitatively different positions were found that were termed Free Market (22%), Pragmatism (15%), Altruism (48%), Always Acceptable (7%), and Undetermined (8%). Nurses comprised the majority (90%) of the members of the altruism cluster. Younger and more-educated people were, more frequently than older and less-educated people, members either of the pragmatism or of the free market cluster.

However, due to the imbalance in the demand  and supply of deceased organs, most transplant centers worldwide have consciously pursued a strategy for living donation. Paired exchanges were introduced as a means to bypass various biologic incompatibilities (blood- and tissue-typing), while expanding the living donor pool. This shift in paradigm has introduced new  ethical concerns that have hitherto been unaddressed, especially with nondirected, altruistic living donors. So far, transplant communities have focused efforts on separate liver- and kidney-paired exchanges, whereas the concept of a transorgan paired exchange has been theorized and could potentially  facilitate a greater number of transplants.

If in principle organ donation is an option after a patient's death, intensive therapeutic measures are regularly required in order to maintain the homeostasis  of the organs. These measures, however, cannot benefit the patient afflicted anymore-which in turn might lead to an ethical conflict between dignified palliative care for him/her and expanded intensive treatment to facilitate organ  donation for others, especially if the patient has opted for the limitation of life-sustaining therapies in an advance directive. METHOD: The Ethics Section and the Organ Donation and Transplantation Section of the German Interdisciplinary Association of Critical Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) have convened several  meetings and a telephone conference and have arrived at a decision-making aid as  to the extent of treatment for potential organ donors. This instrument focusses first on the assessment of five individual dimensions regarding organ donation, namely the certitude of a complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, the patient's wishes as to organ donation, his or her wishes as to limiting life-sustaining therapies, the intensity of expanded intensive treatment for organ protection and the odds of its successful attainment. Then, the combination of the individual assessments, as graphically shown in a {Netzdiagramm}, will allow for a judgement as to whether a continuation or possibly an expansion of intensive care measures is ethically justified, questionable or even inappropriate. RESULT: The aid described can help mitigate ethical conflicts as to the extent of intensive care treatment for moribund patients, when organ donation is a medically sound option.

1845;30976292;Article;2019;World journal of emergency surgery : WJES;;The role of the intra-abdominal view in complicated intra-abdominal infections.;;Background: The prognostic role of what a surgeon observes in the abdomen of patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) is largely unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to systemically analyze components of the intra-abdominal view (IAV) and their association to severe complicated intra-abdominal sepsis (SCIAS) or mortality. Methods: The study cohort consisted  of adult patients with cIAI. The operating surgeon filled a paper form describing the intra-abdominal view. Demographics, operative details, and preoperative physiological status were collected. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistical analyses were performed, and a new score was developed based on regression coefficients. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of SCIAS or  30-day mortality, in which SCIAS was defined as organ dysfunctions requiring intensive care unit admission. Results: A total of 283 patients were analyzed. The primary outcome was encountered in 71 (25%) patients. In the IAV, independent risk factors for the primary outcome were fecal or bile as exudate (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.05-3.73), diffuse peritonitis (OR 2.15, 1.02-4.55), diffuse substantial redness of the peritoneum (OR 5.73, 2.12-15.44),  and a non-appendiceal source of cIAI (OR 11.20, 4.11-30.54). Based on these factors, an IAV score was developed and its performance analyzed. The area under  the receiver operating characteristic for the IAV score was 0.81. The IAV score also correlated significantly with several outcomes and organ dysfunctions. Conclusions: The extent of peritonitis, diffuse substantial redness of the peritoneum, type of exudate, and source of infection associate independently with SCIAS or mortality. A high IAV score associates with mortality and organ dysfunctions, yet it needs further external validation. Combining components of IAV into comprehensive scoring systems for cIAI patients may provide additional value compared to the current scoring systems.

Urine CXCL10 outperforms standard post-transplant surveillance in observational studies, by detecting subclinical rejection and early clinical rejection before graft functional decline in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a phase ii/iii multicentre, international randomised controlled parallel group trial to determine if the early treatment of rejection, as detected by urine CXCL10, will improve kidney allograft outcomes. Incident adult kidney transplant patients (n~420) will be enrolled to undergo routine urine CXCL10 monitoring postkidney transplant. Patients at high risk of rejection, defined as confirmed elevated urine CXCL10 level, will be randomised 1:1 stratified by centre (n=250). The intervention arm (n=125) will undergo a study biopsy to check for subclinical rejection and biopsy-proven rejection will  be treated per protocol. The control arm (n=125) will undergo routine post-transplant monitoring. The primary outcome at 12 months is a composite of death-censored graft loss, clinical biopsy-proven acute rejection, de novo donor-specific antibody, inflammation in areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (Banff i-IFTA, chronic active T-cell mediated rejection) and subclinical tubulitis on 12-month surveillance biopsy. The secondary outcomes include decline of graft function, microvascular inflammation at 12 months, development of IFTA at 12 months, days from transplantation to clinical biopsy-proven rejection, albuminuria, EuroQol five-dimension five-level instrument, cost-effectiveness analysis of the urine CXCL10 monitoring strategy and the urine CXCL10 kinetics in response to rejection therapy.

According to  the IBC any contact between the donor's family and recipient must be managed by a third-party body pertaining to the National Health Service, established to guarantee strict control over the expression of consent in order to avoid any risk of inappropriate behaviour.

Objective: Examine the characteristics of post-transplant SPC encounters, utilization trends, and patient characteristics associated with SPC at a center with established SPC services. Design: Retrospective cohort study of  SPC utilization by 597 lung transplant recipients transplanted between 2010 and 2015. We collected data on pretransplant demographics and post-transplant SPC encounters, including timing, location, and referral reasons. Cumulative incidence of SPC and patient characteristics associated with SPC were examined by competing risks methods. Utilization in the first two post-transplant years was compared between subcohorts defined by year of transplantation. Results: SPC cumulative incidence was 27% and 43% at one and five years. More than 60% of encounters occurred in the first post-transplant year including 34% during the index transplant hospitalization. Over 90% of encounters occurred in the inpatient setting. The majority of consults were for symptom management. From 2010 to 2015 inpatient utilization in the first two post-transplant years increased from 23% to 42%, and outpatient utilization increased from 2% to 16%. Accounting for increasing utilization, pretransplant SPC and double-lung transplantation were associated with greater incidence of post-transplant SPC. Conclusions: Lung transplant recipients may have palliative care needs early after transplantation. Increasing utilization suggests greater awareness of or changing attitudes about the utility of SPC for lung transplant recipients. Understanding transplant recipients' palliative care needs and transplant physicians' views of SPC is critical to improving the provision of SPC in lung transplantation.;;Nolley EP, DeSensi R, Nouraie M, Schenker Y, Morrell MR;;eng;['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Humans', 'Lung Transplantation/*nursing', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/*organization & administration/statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pennsylvania', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplant Recipients/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data'];['*competing risks', '*lung transplant recipients', '*lung transplantation', '*solid organ transplantation', '*specialty palliative care'];;;10.1089/jpm.2018.0560
1849;30957196;Article;2019;The patient;;Systematic Review of Public Preferences for the Allocation of Donor Organs for Transplantation: Principles of Distributive Justice.;;"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for organ failure, but donor organs are a scarce resource because of a large mismatch between supply and demand. This scarcity leads to an ethical dilemma, forcing priority setting in organ allocation to individual patients. Little is known about public preferences regarding priority setting in organ allocation. A systematic review was performed to review the existing evidence and provide an overview of the criteria and criterion levels in regard to ethical aspects of distributive justice. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and PsycINFO databases were searched for literature published between January 2000 and December 2018. Only original studies were selected. The criteria were identified, extracted and grouped into a self-developed matrix according to the principles of distributive justice to ascertain public preferences. RESULTS: Overall, 9645 references were identified, and 15 studies were included. In total, 27 criteria clustered in seven theory-guided groups could be identified: ""equality"", ""effectiveness/benefit"", ""medical urgency"", ""own fault"", ""value for society"", ""medical background"" and ""sociodemographic status"". It was shown that not only a  single principle but rather a combination of principles are relevant for the allocation. Therefore, a public propensity towards a rational utilitarian ethical model of allocation could be recognised. CONCLUSIONS: The general public not only wanted to allocate organs mainly to those with a good probability of having a successful transplantation but also wanted to consider those who need an organ most urgently to prevent fatal consequences, resulting in unclear trade-offs between effectiveness/benefit and medical urgency. Public preferences for organ allocation are therefore complex, and data regarding clear trade-offs are still lacking.";;Oedingen C, Bartling T, Muhlbacher AC, Schrem H, Krauth C;;eng;['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organ Transplantation', '*Social Justice', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration', 'Waiting Lists', 'Young Adult'];;;;10.1007/s40271-019-00363-0

DESIGN: Before and after observational study using bespoke routinely collected data. SETTING: National Health Service Blood and Transplant. PARTICIPANTS: 205 potential organ donor cases in Wales. INTERVENTIONS: The Act and implementation strategy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Consent rates at 18 months post implementation compared with 3 previous years, and organ donor numbers 21 months before and after implementation. Changes in organ donor register activity post implementation for 18 months. RESULTS: The  consent rate for all modes of consent was 61.0% (125/205), showing a recovery from the dip to 45.8% in 2014/2015. 22.4% (46/205) were deemed consented donors:  consent rate 60.8% (28/46). Compared with the 3 years before the switch there was a significant difference in Welsh consent rates (chi(2) p value=0.009). Over the  same time period, rest of the UK consent rates also significantly increased from  58.6% (5256/8969) to 63.1% (2913/4614) (chi(2) p value<0.0001), therefore the Wales increase cannot be attributed to the Welsh legislation change. Deceased donors did not increase: 101 compared with 104. Organ donation registration increased from 34% to 38% with 6% registering to opt-out. CONCLUSION: This is the first rigorous initial evaluation with bespoke data collected on all cases. The longer-term impact on consent rates and donor numbers is unclear. Concerns about  a potential backlash and mass opting out were not realised. The move to a soft opt-out system has not resulted in a step change in organ donation behaviour, but can be seen as the first step of a longer journey. Policymakers should not assume that soft opt-out systems by themselves simply need more time to have a meaningful effect. Ongoing interventions to further enhance implementation and the public's understanding of organ donation are needed to reach the 2020 target  of 80% consent rates.

Incident cases of gout were identified and stratified by CKD status and by age group (< 55 and 55+ years). CKD status was defined as a pre-existing diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, chronic renal  failure, kidney transplantation, or dialysis at index date. Demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as healthcare resource use, were reported. Results: A total of 12,940 incident adult gout patients, with (n = 8286) and without (n = 4654) CKD, were followed for 55,206 person-years. Higher rates of HRU were observed for gout patients with CKD than without. Total annual hospital  admissions for patients with gout and CKD were at least 3 times higher for adults < 55 (mean = 0.51 vs 0.13) and approximately 1.5 times higher for adults 55+ (mean = 0.46 vs 0.29) without CKD. Healthcare utilization rates from year 1 to year 5 remained similar for gout patients < 55 years irrespective of CKD status,  however varied according to healthcare utilization by CKD status for gout patients 55+ years. The 5-year all-cause mortality was higher among those with CKD compared to those without CKD for both age groups (HR< 55 years = 1.65; 95% CI 1.01-2.71; HR55+ years = 1.50; 95% CI 1.37-1.65). Conclusions: The current study suggests important differences exist in patient characteristics and outcomes among patients with gout and CKD. Healthcare utilization differed between sub-populations, age and comorbidities, over the study period and the 5-year mortality risk was higher for gout patients with CKD, regardless of age. Future work should explore factors associated with these outcomes and barriers to gout control in order to enhance patient management among this high-risk subgroup.";;Jaffe DH, Klein AB, Benis A, Flores NM, Gabay H, Morlock R, Teltsch DY, Chapnick J, Molad Y, Giveon SM, Feldman B, Leventer-Roberts M;;eng;;['Chronic kidney disease', 'Gout', 'Healthcare utilization', 'Survival'];This study was approved by the Helsinki Ethics Committee of the CHS (no. 037/2015).

Three workgroups were formed: timing for transplant referral; modifiable barriers to transplant; and transition to transplant care. A focus group of lung transplant recipients with CF and spouses of CF recipients informed guideline development. RESULTS: The committee formulated 21 recommendation statements based on literature review, committee member practices, focus group insights, and in response to public comment. Critical approaches to optimizing access to lung transplant include early discussion of this treatment option, assessment for modifiable barriers to transplant, and open communication between the CF and lung transplant centers.

However, there are numerous patients who cannot find a living kidney donor. Randomised controlled trials have shown that home-based education for patients with ESRD and their family/friends leads to four times more LDKTs. This educational intervention is currently being implemented in eight hospitals in the Netherlands. Supervision and quality assessment are being employed to maintain the quality of the intervention. In this study, we aim to: (1) conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the educational programme and its quality assurance system; (2) investigate the relationship between the quality of the implementation of the intervention and the outcomes knowledge, communication and LDKT activities; and (3) investigate policy implications. METHODS AND DESIGN: Patients with ESRD who do not have a living kidney donor are eligible to receive the home-based educational intervention. This is carried out by allied health transplantation professionals  and psychologists across eight hospitals in the Netherlands. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted with a Markov model. Cost data will be obtained from the literature. We will obtain the quality of life data from the patients who participate in the educational programme. Questionnaires on knowledge and communication will be used to measure the outcomes of the programme. Data on LDKT activities will be obtained from medical records up to 24 months after the education. A protocol adherence measure will be assessed by a third party by means of a telephone interview with the patients and the invitees. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained through all participating hospitals. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific presentations. Results of the cost-effectiveness of the educational programme will also be disseminated to the Dutch National Health Care Institute.

While rates of clinically significant TBLB-related haemorrhage are <1% for all comers, the incidence in lung transplant recipients is reported to be higher, presumably due to persistent allograft inflammation and alterations in allograft blood flow. While routinely performed by some bronchoscopists, the efficacy and safety profile of prophylactic administration of topical intrabronchial diluted epinephrine for the prevention of TBLB-related haemorrhage has not been explored in a prospective manner. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial (PROPHET Study), single-lung and double-lung transplant adult recipients from participating institutions who are scheduled for bronchoscopy with TBLB for clinical indications will be identified. Potential participants who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria and sign an informed consent will be randomised to receive either diluted epinephrine or placebo prior to performance of TBLB. The degree of TBLB-related haemorrhage will be graded by the performing bronchoscopist as well  as independent observers. The primary analysis will compare the rates of severe and very severe bleeding in participants treated with epinephrine or placebo. The study will also evaluate the safety profile of prophylactic topical epinephrine including the occurrence of serious cardiovascular and haemodynamic adverse events. Additional secondary outcomes to be explored include rates of non-severe  TBLB-related haemorrhage, overall yield of the bronchoscopic procedure and non-serious cardiovascular and haemodynamic adverse effects. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study procedures were reviewed and approved by institutional review boards in participating institutions. This study is being externally monitored, and a data and safety monitoring committee has been assembled to monitor patient safety and to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention.

Confucianism has been commonly used as the cultural and ethical reason to explain the reluctance of Chinese and other East-Asian people to donate organs for medical purposes. It is asserted that the  Confucian emphasis on xiao (filial piety) requires individuals to ensure body intactness at death. However, based on the original texts of classical Confucianism and other primary materials, we refute this popular view. We base our position on the related Confucian norms of filial piety and ren (humaneness,  humanity or benevolence), the tension between differentiated love and universal love, and belief in the goodness of human nature. In light of this, we argue that the Confucian ethical outlook actually calls for organ donation at an individual  level, and supports an opt-out (presumed consent) system at the level of social policy. Furthermore, because the popular view is based on a number of dominant but misleading modes of thinking about cultural differences, our revisionist account of Confucian moral duties regarding organ donation has implications for developing a more adequate transcultural and global bioethics. These will be discussed and expanded upon.;;Nie JB, Jones DG;;eng;['Altruism', 'China', '*Confucianism', 'Humans', '*Morals', 'Parent-Child Relations/ethnology', 'Religion and Medicine', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['China', 'Confucianism', 'Organ donation', 'Ren (humaneness or benevolence)', 'Transcultural bioethics', 'Xiao (filial piety)'];;;10.1007/s11019-019-09893-8
1860;30872550;Article;2019;BMJ open;;Randomised controlled trial of a video intervention and behaviour contract to improve medication adherence after renal transplantation: the VECTOR study protocol.;;"INTRODUCTION: Non-adherence after kidney transplantation contributes to increased rejections, hospitalisations and healthcare expenditures. Although effective adherence interventions are sorely needed, increasing education and support to transplant recipients demands greater use of care providers' time and resources in a healthcare system that is stretched. The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of an electronically delivered video series and adherence behaviour contract on improving medication adherence to immunosuppressant medications. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel arm, randomised controlled trial will be conducted with four sites across North America (Saskatoon, Calgary, Halifax, Chicago). Adult patients will be randomised (1:1) to either the intervention (ie, home-based video education +behaviour contract plus usual care) or usual care alone. De novo transplant recipients will be enrolled prior to their hospital discharge and will be provided with electronic access to the video intervention (immediately) and adherence contract  (1 month post-transplant). Follow-up electronic surveys will be provided at 3 and 12 months postenrolment. The primary outcome will be adherence at 12 months post-transplant, as measured by self-report Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive medications and immunosuppressant levels. Secondary outcomes include the difference in knowledge score between the intervention and control in groups (measured by the Kidney Transplant Understanding Tool); differences in self-efficacy (Generalised Self-efficacy Scale), Beliefs of Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ), quality of life (Short Form-12), patient satisfaction and cost utilisation. The study aims to recruit at least 200 participants across participating sites. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Saskatchewan Behavioural Ethics Committee (Beh 18-63), and all  patients provide informed consent prior to participating. This educational intervention aims to improve information retention and self-efficacy, leading to  improved medication adherence after kidney transplantation, at low cost, with little impact to existing healthcare personnel. If proven beneficial, delivery can be easily implemented into standard of care.

WDGMC is a private academic hospital in Johannesburg and serves to supplement the specialist and subspecialist medical training provided by the University of the Witwatersrand. Over the past 14 years, our liver transplant programme has evolved from a sometimes fractured service into the largest-volume liver centre in sub-Saharan Africa. The growth of our programme has been the result of a number of innovative strategies tailored to the unique nature of transplant service provision. These include an employment model for doctors, a robust training and research programme, and a collaboration with the Gauteng Department of Health (GDoH) that  allows us to provide liver transplantation to state sector patients and promotes  equality. We have also encountered numerous challenges, and these continue, especially in our endeavour to make access to liver transplantation equitable but also an economically viable option for our hospital. In this article, we detail the liver transplant model at WDGMC, fully outlining the successes, challenges and innovations that have arisen through considering the provision of transplant  services from a different perspective.

METHOD: A multicentre retrospective study by conducted by reviewing the hospital discharge reports corresponding to deceased patients in 8 Spanish PICUs between 2011 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 337 deaths were recorded, of which 151 (50'7%) occurred after a decision of LET, while 114 (33'8%) were due to an indicated, but failed, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 52 (15.4%) were due to brain death. The most common causes of hospital admission for those children that finally died were a heart-related problem (32.6%) or a respiratory problem (22.6%). A total of 86 cases (25.5%) had a previous hospital admission, with 253 cases (75%) suffering from some type of chronical illness, and 78 (23%) had a serious disability at the time of the admission. LET cases were more frequent among these children and those suffering from cancer. The predominant LET type consisted in: not starting  the CPR in the event of a cardiac arrest (45%), withdrawal of the respiratory support (31.6%), and withdrawal of vasoactive drugs (21.6%). CONCLUSIONS: At the  present time, at least half of the children dying in a PICU in Spain die after a  LET decision, which is more frequent in those patients with previous hospital admissions, with a serious incapacity, and chronic or oncological disease.

1865;30798504;Article;2019;Irish journal of medical science;;Ethical dilemmas related to living donor liver transplantation in Asia.;;Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has evolved rapidly in Asia with good outcomes for both donor and recipient. Nonetheless, LDLT remains a highly demanding technique and complex surgery. The potential risks to the donors provide the basis for many of the ethical dilemmas associated with LDLT. The transplant team must have a good knowledge of the principles of bioethics in order to handle these matters. To look after the need, donor's safety and the chance for good recipient outcomes, the principles of respect for the donor's autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence should be practiced. In accordance with the concept of equipoise, the risk to the donor must balance the benefit to  the recipient. The transplant center should have adequate experience and proven expertise in LDLT. There are concerns regarding the validity of informed consent  given by the donor. While donations to non-relative patients may, at first sight, indicate radical altruism, it is important to apply careful scrutiny. Though organ trading is strictly prohibited by the law, there seems to be an inherent risk with directed donations to strangers. Transplant tourism has flourished in some countries in spite of the existence of strict laws. There are reservations regarding transplantation done by foreign visiting teams. Donor websites facilitating patients and donors and Facebook pages bear no responsibility for the outcomes of their matches and cannot ensure sufficient and accurate information about donation, transplantation, and post-operation life.

Recently in the United Kingdom 457 people died as a result of organ shortage in just 1 year. (1) NHS Blood and Transplant suggest national debates to test public attitudes to radical actions to increase  organ donation should be considered in addressing organ shortage. The selling of  organs for transplant in the United Kingdom is prohibited under the Human Tissue  Act 2004. This discussion paper considers five ethical objections raised in the United Kingdom to paid donation and discusses how these objections are addressed  within the only legal and regulated paid living unrelated renal donation programme in the world in Iran, where its kidney transplant list was eliminated within 2 years of its commencement. This article discusses whether paid living unrelated donation in Iran increases riskier donations and reduced altruistic donation as opponents of paid donation claim. The paper debates whether objections to paid donation based upon commodification arguments only oppose enabling financial ends, even if these ends enable beneficent acts. Discussions in relation to whether valid consent can be given by the donor will take place and will also debate the objection that donors will be coerced and exploited by a paid model. This article suggests that exploitation of the paid donor within the  Iranian model exists within the legally permitted framework. However, paid living kidney donation should be discussed further and other models of paid donation considered in the United Kingdom as a radical means of increasing donation.;;Timmins R, Sque M;;eng;['Government Programs/ethics/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Healthcare Financing/*ethics', 'Humans', 'State Medicine/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'United Kingdom'];['Altruism', 'Consent', 'Iran', 'Organ Donation', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1177/0969733019826362
1867;30777381;Article;2019;Journal of the National Medical Association;;African-Americans with End Stage Renal Disease in the Early Years of Kidney Transplantation.;;"INTRODUCTION: The first successful kidney transplant in humans was performed in 1954. In the following 25 years, the biomedical, ethical, and social implications of kidney transplantation were widely discussed by both healthcare professionals  and the public. Issues relating to race, however, were not commonly addressed, representing a ""blind spot"" regarding racial disparities in access and health outcomes. METHODS: Through primary sources in the medical literature and lay press, this paper explores the racial dynamics of kidney transplantation in the 1950-1970s in the United States as the procedure grew from an experimental procedure to the standard of care for patients in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). RESULTS & DISCUSSION: An extensive search of the medical literature found very few papers about ESRD, dialysis, or renal transplant that mentioned the race of the patients before 1975. While the search did not reveal whether race was explicitly used in determining patient access to dialysis or transplant, the scant data that exist show that African-Americans disproportionately developed ESRD and were underrepresented in these early treatment populations. Transplant outcome data in the United States failed to include race demographics until the late 1970s. The Social Security Act of 1972 (PL 92-603) extended Medicare coverage to almost all Americans with ESRD and led to a rapid increase in both dialysis and kidney transplantation for African-Americans in ESRD, but disparities persist today.";;Wang JY, Lederer SE, Ross LF;;eng;['African Americans/history/*statistics & numerical data', 'Dialysis', 'Health Services Accessibility/history', 'Healthcare Disparities/ethnology/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*ethnology/history/surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*history', 'Medicare/history/legislation & jurisprudence', 'United States'];['African-Americans', 'Disparities', 'End stage renal disease (ESRD)', 'History', 'Kidney transplantation', 'Race/ethnicity'];;;10.1016/j.jnma.2019.01.005

To characterize stakeholder attitudes about organ recovery before circulatory death we conducted semistructured interviews with family members (N = 15) who had experienced a loved one's unsuccessful donation after circulatory death and focus groups with professional stakeholders (surgeons, anesthesiologists, critical care specialists, palliative care specialists, organ procurement personnel, and policymakers, N = 46). We then used qualitative content analysis to characterize  these perspectives. Professional stakeholders believed that donation of all organs before circulatory death was unacceptable, morally repulsive, and equivalent to murder; consent for such a procedure would be impermissible. Respondents feared the social costs related to recovery before death were too high. Although beliefs about recovery of all organs were widely shared, some professional stakeholders could accommodate removal of a single kidney before circulatory death. In contrast, family members were typically accepting of donation before circulatory death for a single kidney, and many believed recovery of all organs was permissible because they believed the cause of death was the donor's injury, not organ procurement. These findings suggest that definitions of death and precise rules around organ donation are critical for professional stakeholders, whereas donor families find less relevance in these constructs for  determining the acceptability of organ donation. Donation of a single kidney before circulatory death warrants future exploration.";;Zimmermann CJ, Baggett ND, Taylor LJ, Buffington A, Scalea J, Fost N, Croes KD, Mezrich JD, Schwarze ML;;eng;['Aged', '*Decision Making', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Qualitative Research', 'Tissue Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['*clinical research/practice', '*donors and donation', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*organ procurement', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*organ transplantation in general', '*qualitative research'];;T32 HL110853/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.15310
1869;30762665;Article;2019;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Financial compensation for organ donors.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With an increasing demand for donor organs, strategies to increase the number of available donor organs have become more focused. Compensating donors for donation is one strategy proposed to increase the availability of organs for transplant. This has been implemented in several systems internationally, but debate continues in the United States with respect to appropriate strategies. The National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) currently prohibits the transfer of any human organ 'for valuable consideration' for transplantation, but allows for the removal of financial disincentives. RECENT FINDINGS: Several proposals currently exist for compensating patients for living  donation. Recent data have focused on studying and creating mechanisms for reimbursement of costs incurred as part of the donation process, which is related to the removal of disincentives to living donation. Others have advocated for the provision of actual incentives to patients for the act of donating, in an attempt to further expand living donation. The current debate focuses on what measures can reasonably be taken to increase donation, and whether additional incentives will encourage more donation or reduce the motivation for altruistic donation. SUMMARY: Currently, the transplant community broadly supports the removal of disincentives for living donors, including reimbursement of expenses for travel,  housing and lost wages incurred during evaluation, surgery and after care. Others have advocated for financial incentives to further increase the number of donor organs available for transplant. Although the removal of disincentives is currently allowed under the existing legal structure of NOTA, providing financial incentives for living donation would require further evaluation of the economics, law, ethics and public readiness for a significant policy shift.;;Harbell JW, Mathur AK;;eng;['*Financial Support', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Living Donors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data/supply & distribution', 'Motivation', 'Organ Transplantation/*economics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/organization & administration', 'United States'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000617

In the past few years, the  VA Transplant Program has received criticism that can be characterized as follows: the location of VA Transplant Centers (VATCs) requires Veterans to travel considerable distances for transplant care and services; the National Surgery Office (NSO) that provides oversight limits the number of active VATCs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policy limits referral of Veterans to non-VA transplant centers (community care); and the VA Transplant Program does not provide living donor transplant procedures. The MISSION Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-182) was enacted in part to address these themes by promoting community care  and living donation. This article provides perspective regarding the VA Transplant Program and rebuttal to stated criticism: Travel to a transplant center is not isolated to the VA; the NSO does not limit VATC activation; current VHA policy authorizes community care; and the VA Transplant Program currently performs living donor procedures. The MISSION Act, as intended, has the potential to decrease referrals to the VA Transplant Program by 30%.";;Gunnar W;;eng;['Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals, Veterans/organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Living Donors', 'Organ Transplantation/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Program Evaluation', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Transplants', 'United States', '*United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans'];['*donors and donation: living', '*education', '*ethics and public policy', '*organ transplantation in general', '*patient safety', '*patient survival', '*quality of care/care delivery'];;;10.1111/ajt.15295

BACKGROUND: Pediatric VAD use is a standard therapy for advanced heart failure. Serious adverse events may affect relative benefit of continued support, leading to consideration of VADdeact. Perspectives  and practices regarding VADdeact have been studied in adults but not in children. METHODS: A web-based anonymous survey of clinicians for pediatric VAD patients (<18 years) was sent to list-serves for the ISHLT Pediatric Council, the International Consortium of Circulatory Assist Clinicians Pediatric Taskforce, and the Pediatric Cardiac Intensivist Society. RESULTS: A total of 106 respondents met inclusion criteria of caring for pediatric VAD patients. Annual VAD volume per clinician ranged from <4 (33%) to >9 (20%). Seventy percent of respondents had performed VADdeact of a child. Response varied to VADdeact requests by parent or patient and was influenced by professional degree and region of practice. Except for the scenario of intractable suffering, no consensus on VADdeact appropriateness was reported. Age of child thought capable  of making informed requests for VADdeact varied by subspecialty. The majority of  respondents (62%) do not feel fully informed of relevant legal issues; 84% reported that professional society supported guidelines for VADdeact in children  had utility. CONCLUSION: There is limited consensus regarding indications for VADdeact in children reported by pediatric VAD provider survey respondents. Knowledge gaps related to legal issues are evident; therefore, professional guidelines and educational resources related to pediatric VADdeact are needed.";;Kaufman BD, Hollander SA, Zhang Y, Chen S, Bernstein D, Rosenthal DN, Almond CS, Murray JM, Burgart AM, Cohen HJ, Kirkpatrick JN, Blume ED;;eng;"['Adolescent', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Decision Making', 'Heart Failure/*therapy', 'Heart Transplantation', '*Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent By Minors', 'International Cooperation', 'Internet', 'Nurses', 'Palliative Care/methods', 'Pediatrics/*methods', 'Physicians', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States', 'Withholding Treatment/*ethics/*statistics & numerical data']";['*decision-making', '*palliative care', '*pediatric mechanical circulatory support', '*ventricular assist device'];;;10.1111/petr.13359

Although each addresses at least one barrier to transplantation, these innovative programs raise important ethical, logistical, and regulatory considerations. RECENT FINDINGS: This review addresses four recent proposals to expand living donor transplantation. For kidney transplantation, we  discuss global paired exchange and advanced donation programs ('vouchers') and for liver transplantation, liver paired exchange. Lastly, this review considers trans-organ exchange. We explore the conceptual framework of the exchange, current status, benefits, and concerns for implementation among each of these evolving pathways. SUMMARY: Through highlighting novel mechanisms in organ exchange, greater awareness, discussion, or support can occur to create more avenues for transplantation. These innovative mechanisms require regulations and  safeguards for donors to ensure informed consent, and proper follow-up is maintained.;;Lo AL, Sonnenberg EM, Abt PL;;eng;['*Directed Tissue Donation', 'Global Health', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*standards', 'Kidney Transplantation/*ethics', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics', 'Tissue Donors/ethics/*supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*organization & administration/standards'];;;T32 DK007006/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000621

1874;30725134;Article;2019;Intensive care medicine;;Organ donation after circulatory death: current status and future potential.;;The continuing shortage of deceased donor organs for transplantation, and the limited number of potential donors after brain death, has led to a resurgence of  interest in donation after circulatory death (DCD). The processes of warm and cold ischemia threaten the viability of DCD organs, but these can be minimized by well-organized DCD pathways and new techniques of in situ organ preservation and  ex situ resuscitation and repair post-explantation. Transplantation survival after DCD is comparable to donation after brain death despite higher rates of primary non-function and delayed graft function. Countries with successfully implemented DCD programs have achieved this primarily through the establishment of national ethical, professional and legal frameworks to address both public and professional concerns with all aspects of the DCD pathway. It is unlikely that expanding standard DCD programs will, in isolation, be sufficient to address the  worldwide shortage of donor organs for transplantation. It is therefore likely that reliance on extended criteria donors will increase, with the attendant imperative to minimize ischemic injury to candidate organs. Normothermic regional perfusion and ex situ perfusion techniques allow enhanced preservation, assessment, resuscitation and/or repair of damaged organs as a way of improving overall organ quality and preventing the unnecessary discarding of DCD organs. This review will outline exemplar controlled and uncontrolled DCD pathways, highlighting practical and logistical considerations that minimize warm and cold  ischemia times while addressing potential ethical concerns. Future perspectives will also be discussed.;;Smith M, Dominguez-Gil B, Greer DM, Manara AR, Souter MJ;;eng;['Humans', 'Mass Screening/methods/trends', 'Organ Preservation/methods/trends', 'Shock/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Tissue Donors/supply & distribution', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*methods/trends'];['*Donation after circulatory death', '*Ethics', '*Organ donation'];;;10.1007/s00134-019-05533-0
1875;30723071;Article;2019;BMJ open;;Compliance with ethical standards in the reporting of donor sources and ethics review in peer-reviewed publications involving organ transplantation in China: a  scoping review.;;"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate whether papers reporting research on Chinese transplant recipients comply with international professional standards aimed at excluding publication of research that: (1) involves any biological material from executed prisoners; (2) lacks Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and (3) lacks consent of donors. DESIGN: Scoping review based on Arksey and O'Mallee's methodological framework. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Scopus and Embase were searched from January 2000 to April 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included research papers published in peer-reviewed English-language journals reporting on outcomes of research involving recipients  of transplanted hearts, livers or lungs in mainland China. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by individual authors working independently following training and benchmarking. Descriptive statistics were compiled using Excel. RESULTS: 445 included studies reported on outcomes of 85 477 transplants.  412 (92.5%) failed to report whether or not organs were sourced from executed prisoners; and 439 (99%) failed to report that organ sources gave consent for transplantation. In contrast, 324 (73%) reported approval from an IRB. Of the papers claiming that no prisoners' organs were involved in the transplants, 19 of them involved 2688 transplants that took place prior to 2010, when there was no volunteer donor programme in China. DISCUSSION: The transplant research community has failed to implement ethical standards banning publication of research using material from executed prisoners. As a result, a large body of unethical research now exists, raising issues of complicity and moral hazard to the extent that the  transplant community uses and benefits from the results of this research.

Towards this  end, a literature search was conducted in PubMed and free Internet searches. Interviews with individuals and focus group discussions were held with HBV experts in KSA. Although significant improvements have been made in the past 30 years in KSA in terms of the decline in prevalence (currently estimated to be around 1.3%), the morbidity and mortality related to the disease have not shown a parallel decline. This makes HBV an important public health concern. Furthermore, poor disease awareness, low diagnosis rates, and nonadherence to therapy amplify  the disease burden. There are several mandated national screening structures present; however, established protocols for those who test positive and subsequent linkage-to-care are inadequate.

Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients  over 65 years of age, and carries with it a 5-year mortality of nearly 50%. Despite advances in medical therapy, treatment for medically refractory end-stage, advanced heart failure is limited to heart transplant, mechanical circulatory support (MCS), or palliative care only. Patient selection in advanced heart failure (AHF) therapy is complex. Not only are the patients medically complicated, but providers are biased by their individual and collective experience with similar and dissimilar patients. Clinicians caring for AHF patients balance competing clinical and ethical demands, which appropriately leads to professional debate and disagreement.

The chapters on postmortem organ procurement distinguish between 'giving' and 'taking' systems, and argue that 'taking' systems may promise a greater yield of organs for transplantation, but inevitably violate a requirement of respect for the deceased's autonomy. That argument has been very influential, and is also representative of a way of thinking that is widespread in the literature and in public debate. In this paper I contend that it is conceptually flawed in a number of important respects. These concern the understanding of both the concept of 'consent' and the requirement of respect for autonomy, the role of the relatives in any procurement system, and the factors that actually determine the extent to which a system respects autonomy, under any interpretation of that requirement.;;den Hartogh G;;eng;['Cadaver', 'Family', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', '*Personal Autonomy', '*Respect', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['*opt-in', '*opt-out', '*organ donation', '*organ procurement', '*presumed consent', '*tacit consent'];;;10.1111/bioe.12553

However, when these funding sources expire by adulthood, most are unable to pay for follow-up appointments and immunosuppressive medications necessary for maintenance of their organ. The organs fail and patients are then left with the options of retransplantation or a lifetime of dialysis. The dilemma of retransplantation introduces many questions regarding justice and fairness. This commentary addresses several ethical concerns about the special case of organ retransplantation for undocumented patients.

1882;30659043;Article;2019;BMJ open;;PreImplantation Trial of Histopathology In renal Allografts (PITHIA): a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial protocol.;;"INTRODUCTION: Most potential kidney transplant donors in the UK are aged over 60  years, yet increasing donor age is associated with poorer graft survival and function. Urgent preimplantation kidney biopsy can identify chronic injury, and may aid selection of better 'quality' kidneys from this group. However, the impact of biopsy on transplant numbers remains unproven. The PreImplantation Trial of Histopathology In renal Allografts (PITHIA) study will assess whether the introduction of a national, 24 hours, digital histopathology service increases the number, and improves outcomes, of kidneys transplanted in the UK from older deceased donors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PITHIA is an open, multicentre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised study, involving all UK adult kidney transplant  centres. At 4-monthly intervals, a group of 4-5 randomly selected clusters (transplant centres) will be given access to remote, urgent, digital histopathology (total intervention period, 24 months). The trial has two primary  end points: it is powered for an 11% increase in the proportion of primary kidney offers from deceased donors aged over 60 years that are transplanted, and a 6 mL/min increase in the estimated glomerular filtration rate of recipients at 12 months post-transplant. This would equate to an additional 120 kidney transplants performed in the UK annually. Trial outcome data will be collected centrally via  the UK Transplant Registry held by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) and will be analysed using mixed effects models allowing for clustering within centres and adjusting for secular trends. An accompanying economic evaluation will estimate the cost-effectiveness of the service to the National Health Service. ETHICS AND  DISSEMINATION: The study has been given favourable ethical opinion by the Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee and is approved by the Health Research  Authority. We will present our findings at key transplant meetings, publish results within 4 years of the trial commencing and support volunteers at renal patient groups to disseminate the trial outcome.

Consensus was reached in all recommendations through a deliberative process. After a public consultation, the final recommendations were institutionally adopted by SEMICYUC, ONT, and the Transplant Committee of the National Health-Care System. This article reports on the resulting recommendations on ICOD for patients with a devastating brain injury for whom the decision has been made not to apply any medical or surgical treatment with a curative purpose on the grounds of futility. Emphasis is made on the systematic referral of these patients to donor coordinators, the proper assessment of the likelihood of brain death and medical suitability, and on transparency in communication with the patient's family. The legal and ethical aspects of ICOD are addressed.

1886;30599807;Article;2019;Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.);;A National Survey of Attitudes of the Zionist Ultra-Orthodox Community in Israel  to Organ Donation.;;BACKGROUND: The Council of the Chief Rabbinate formally accepted neurologically declared death as an indication of death for all legal and religious purposes following changes made to practice parameters in order to comply with Jewish Law  (halacha). This removed Jewish-legal barriers for organ donation. We surveyed the Zionist ultra-Orthodox community to identify the reasons for their continued reluctance to donate. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed to assess personal, cultural, religious, and system-related considerations relating to organ donation. A telephone survey of persons identifying themselves with the Zionist ultra-Orthodox community was conducted to include 300 respondents (150 males and  150 females). RESULTS: The response rate was 5.5% (300 of 6799 approached). While most participants (79%) agreed that organ donation improved or saved lives, a minority (25%) expressed willingness to donate. The most important inhibiting factors were related to religion, namely, importance of being buried intact (84%) and donation being against halacha (46%). Most respondents (67%) would approach a religious figure for advice, and willingness to donate increased when informed that donation was permitted (68%) and supported (63%) by orthodox religious authorities. Finally, a minority (37%) perceived the allocation process to be fair and adequately supervised (36%). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified religious and system-related constraints as important inhibiting factors to donation, factors which were potentially modifiable. Since this community relies  on their religious leaders for guidance, public support by authoritative and accepted religious leaders is required to reassure the community of the legitimacy and positive aspects of organ donation.;;Ashkenazi T, Steinberg A, Cohen J;;eng;['Adult', '*Attitude to Health', '*Cultural Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel', '*Jews', 'Male', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires'];['*organ donation', '*questionnaire', '*zionist ultra-orthodox community'];;;10.1177/1526924818817062

Hesitancy stems largely from fears of eroding public trust due to complex ethical issues involving consent. Beyond ethical concerns, uDCD creates unique logistic challenges to obtain and to preserve organs within a short time frame. This mandates that organ recovery centers be able to rapidly mobilize, and that traditional cold preservation techniques may be inadequate. Proof of effective uDCD organ recovery comes from several European nations, and the frequency of its use is increasing due to early promising results. These scarce resources provide  life-saving organs to desperate transplant candidates who otherwise experience high morbidity and mortality on a transplant waitlist. The objective of this review will be to provide an overview of the European experience with uDCD and discuss the unique ethical and logistic challenges associated with its implementation in the United States.

Given the history and ongoing dependence of transplantation on public support for funding and organs, understanding and incorporating public attitudes into allocation decisions seems  appropriate. In the context of the current controversy around liver allocation, we sought to determine public preferences about issues relevant to the debate. We performed multiple surveys of attitudes around donation and evaluated these using conjoint analysis and clarifying follow-up questions. We found little public support that allocation decisions should be based solely on risk of waiting-list  mortality. Strong public sentiment supported maximizing outcomes after transplantation, prioritizing US citizens or residents, keeping organs local, and considering cost in allocation decisions. We then present a methodology for incorporating these preferences into the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (or MELD) priority score.

In a review of our current clinical practice, we identified multiple regulatory and clinical barriers. For live donation, mandatory reporting of postdonation donor deaths within 2 years constitutes a strong programmatic disincentive. We propose that the United Network for Organ Sharing should provide explicit regulatory guidance  and reassurance for programs wishing to offer live donation to patients at higher risk of death during the reporting period. Under the proposal, live donor deaths  within 30 days would still be regarded as donation-related, but later deaths would be related to the underlying disease. For deceased donation, donation after circulatory death (DCD) immediately following self-directed withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (""conscious DCD"") is not universally covered by existing DCD agreements with donor hospitals. Organ procurement organizations should thus systematically strive to revise these agreements. Obtaining adequate  first-person consent from these communicatively severely impaired patients may be challenging. Optimized preservation and allocation protocols may maximize utilization of these DCD kidneys. Robust public debate and action by all stakeholders is necessary to lower existing barriers and maximize donation opportunities for patients with chronic neurological conditions.";;Troppmann C, Santhanakrishnan C, Sageshima J, McVicar J, Perez R;;eng;['Adult', '*Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', '*Brain Death', 'Donor Selection/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*legislation & jurisprudence'];['*Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)', '*clinical research/practice', '*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*donors and donation: donor evaluation', '*donors and donation: living', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*kidney transplantation/nephrology', '*law/legislation', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;;10.1111/ajt.15230
1890;30563878;Article;2019;Pediatrics;;When a Child Needs a Transplant but Lacks Familial Social Support.;;We present the case of a 19-month-old boy with complex congenital heart disease.  His single father is skeptical of traditional medicine and does not offer the social support needed to make heart transplantation successful for his son. After the father demonstrates commitment to transplant success and provides enhanced social support, doctors place the child on a Berlin Heart (a biventricular assist device) as a bridge to transplantation and list him for transplant. When the child is matched to a donor heart, the father refuses transplantation, despite that it is the child's only chance for survival. His doctors report the case to child protective services, but they decline to take protective custody. The father then changes his mind and asks that the child be put back on the waiting list for transplant. By this time, the social supports the father implemented are no longer in place. This case raises a number of issues. First, should courts order heart transplantation when doctors believe that it is in the child's best interest and parents do not consent? Second, once parents refuse a transplant, can they change their minds? Third, if there are uncertainties regarding whether  the child has the social support to make transplantation successful, should the child be relisted? Finally, should a child who is not currently a transplant candidate but who may become one in the future be supported with ventricular assist devices?;;Mabel H, Harrison CH, Ahmad MU, Blume ED, Boyle GJ, Bester JC, Lantos JD;;eng;['*Father-Child Relations', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*diagnosis/psychology/surgery', 'Heart Transplantation/*ethics/psychology', 'Heart-Assist Devices/*ethics/psychology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Patient Care Team/ethics/trends', '*Social Support', '*Waiting Lists'];;POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: The authors have indicated they have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.;;10.1542/peds.2018-1551

1893;30549359;Article;2019;Journal of clinical nursing;;The role of specialist nurses for organ donation: A solution for maximising organ donation rates?;;AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the role that Donor Transplant Co-ordinators have played and the future potential of Specialist Nurses for Organ Donation (SN-ODs), within organ donation strategies in the UK and other countries. BACKGROUND: Organ donation and transplantation rates vary extensively around the world. However, there is a universal shortage of deceased donors, prompting different approaches  to increase transplantation rates. Within the UK, the Clinical Lead for Organ Donation and Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation undertake a key role in the implementation of the Organ Donation Strategy. The Human Transplantation (Wales)  Act 2015 is a recent development which facilities a deemed (presumed) consent approach to organ donation, the Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation undertakes a major role identifying the potential donor in this situation by confirming the deemed consent status of the donor and supporting bereaved relatives. UK governments in England and Scotland are currently seeking legislative changes to  an opt-out system of organ donation, in line with the Wales change. DESIGN: This  discursive paper explores the role from Donor Transplant Co-ordinator to Specialist Nurse in Organ Donation (SN-OD) within organ donation policy in different settings, but with a specific focus on the UK. The paper clarifies the  current and future potential of nurses working with bereaved families when requesting authorisation for donation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The current scope and future potential of Donor Transplant Co-ordinator and Specialist Nurse  in Organ Donation roles need better recognition. Little empirical data exist about the key role that these nurses play in the organ donation process, especially in relation to gaining authorisation to proceed to donation. CONCLUSION: There is a need to clarify the role of the Specialist Nurse in Organ  Donation and their impact on improving rates of organ donation.;;Tocher J, Neades B, Smith GD, Kelly D;;eng;"['Humans', 'Leadership', 'Nurse Specialists/*organization & administration', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Organ Transplantation/*nursing', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration', 'United Kingdom']";['ethics', 'nursing roles', 'specialist nurses', 'transplantation'];;;10.1111/jocn.14741

The ethics of VCA have moved past doubts about the morality of attempting such transplants to how to conduct them ethically. METHODS: Leaders of each program performing and/or evaluating VCA in the United States were invited to participate in a working group to assess the state and future of VCA ethics and policy. Four meetings were held over the course of 1 year to describe key challenges and potential solutions. RESULTS: Working group participants concluded that VCA holds great promise as treatment for patients with particular injuries or deficits, but the field faces unique challenges to adoption as standard of care, which can only be  overcome by data sharing and standardization of evaluation and outcome metrics. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate attention must be given to concerns including managing the  uniquely intense physician-patient relationship, ethical patient selection, ensuring patients have adequate representation, informing and earning the trust of the public for donation, standardizing metrics for success, and fostering an environment of data sharing. These steps are critical to transitioning VCA from research to standard of care and to its insurance coverage inclusion.;;Caplan AL, Parent B, Kahn J, Dean W, Kimberly LL, Lee WPA, Rodriguez ED;;eng;['Clinical Decision-Making/ethics', 'Consensus', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Patient Rights/ethics', 'Patient Selection/ethics', 'Physician-Patient Relations/ethics', 'Public Opinion', 'Transplantation, Homologous/ethics', 'Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation/adverse effects/*ethics/trends'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000002478

As a result, centers transplant sicker patients, leading to increased length of initial hospitalization. The care of patients who have accumulated functional deficits or additional organ dysfunction during their prolonged stay can be ethically complex. Disagreement occurs between the transplant team, patients and families, and non-transplant health care professionals over the burdens of ongoing intensive intervention. These cases highlight important ethical issues in organ transplantation, including the nature and requirements of transplant informed consent, the limits of physician prognostication, patient autonomy and decision-making capacity following transplant, obligations to organ donors and to other potential recipients, and the impact of program metrics on individualized recipient care.

1897;30105489;Article;2019;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;Leaving gift-giving behind: the ethical status of the human body and transplant medicine.;;The paper argues that the idea of gift-giving and its associated imagery, which has been founding the ethics of organ transplants since the time of the first successful transplants, should be abandoned because it cannot effectively block arguments for (regulated) markets in human body parts. The imagery suggests that  human bodies or their parts are transferable objects which belong to individuals. Such imagery is, however, neither a self-evident nor anthropologically unproblematic construal of the relation between a human being and their body. The paper proposes an alternative conceptualization of that relation, the identity view according to which a human being is identical with their living body. This view, which offers a new ethical perspective on some central concepts of transplant medicine and its ethical and legal standards and institutions, supports widely shared intuitive ethical judgments. On this proposal, an act of selling a human body or one of its parts is an act of trade in human beings, not  in owned objects. Transfers of human body parts for treatment purposes are to be  seen as sharing in another human being's misfortune rather than as giving owned objects. From the perspective of policy-making, the proposal requires, first, that informed consent for removal of transplant material be obtained from the potential benefactor. Secondly, explicit consent by the prospective benefactor is obligatory in the case of removal of transplant material from a living benefactor. Thirdly, in the case of posthumous retrieval, informed consent by the potential benefactor during their life is not ethically indispensable. Additionally, while refusal of posthumous retrieval expressed by a potential benefactor during their life must be respected, such a refusal needs ethical justification and explanation.;;Lukow P;;eng;['*Human Body', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics/psychology', 'Morals', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics', 'Philosophy, Medical', 'Policy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];['Human embodiment', 'Human person', 'Organ procurement', 'Sharing', 'Transplant ethics'];;2015/17/B/HS1/02390/Narodowe Centrum Nauki;10.1007/s11019-018-9862-x

As the number of transplanted organs from  DCD donors continues to increase, there is an essential need to address the ethical aspects of DCD in institutional DCD protocols and clinical practice. Ethical issues of respecting the end-of-life wishes of a potential donor, respecting a recipient's wishes, and addressing potential conflicts of interest are important considerations in developing policies and procedures for DCD programs. Although there may be diversity among DCD programs in Europe, Australia, Israel, China, the United States, and Canada, addressing ethical considerations in these DCD programs is essential to respect donors and recipients during the altruistic and generous act of organ donation.;;Jericho BG;;eng;['*Death', 'Humans', '*Internationality', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/methods', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/methods'];;;;10.1213/ANE.0000000000003448
1899;33587429;Article;2020;Transplantation;;Canadian Society of Transplantation White Paper: Ethical and Legal Considerations for Alcohol and Cannabis Use in Solid Organ Listing and Allocation.;;"Alcohol and cannabis use as a contraindication to organ transplantation is a controversial issue. Until recently, patients in Canada with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) were required to demonstrate abstinence for 6 months in order to receive a liver transplant. There is no equivalent rule that is applied consistently for cannabis use. There is some evidence that alcohol and cannabis use disorder pretransplant could be associated with worse outcomes posttransplantation. However, early liver transplantation for patients with ALD in France and in the U.S. has led to challenges of the 6-month abstinence rule in Canada in the media. It has also resulted in several legal challenges arguing that the rule violates human rights laws regarding discrimination in the provision of medical services and that the rule is also unconstitutional (this challenge is still before the court). Recent legalization of cannabis use for adults in Canada has led to questions about the appropriateness of limiting transplant access based on cannabis use. The ethics committee of the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST) was asked to provide an ethical analysis of cannabis and alcohol abstinence policies. Our conclusions were as follows: neither cannabis use nor the 6-month abstinence rule for alcohol use should be an absolute contraindication to transplantation, and transplant could be offered to  selected patients, further research should be conducted to ensure evidence-based  policies; and the transplant community has a duty not to perpetuate stigma associated with alcohol and cannabis use disorders.";;Greenberg R, Goldberg A, Anthony S, Buchman DZ, Delaney S, Gruben V, Holdsworth S, Le Foll B, Leung M, Lien D, Lynch MJ, Selzner N, Chandler JA, Fortin MC;;eng;;;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000003618

1904;33303650;Article;2020;Journal of medical ethics;;Procedural safeguards cannot disentangle MAiD from organ donation decisions.;;In the past, a vast majority of medical assistance in dying (MAiD) patients were  elderly patients with cancer who are not suitable for organ donation, making organ donation from such patients a rare event. However, more expansive criteria  for MAiD combined with an increased participation of MAiD patients in organ donation is likely to drastically increase the pool of MAiD patients who can serve as organ donors. Previous discussions of ethical issues arising from these  trends have not fully addressed difficulties involved in separating decision to end one's life from the one to donate one's organs. However, realities of organ donation logistics and human decision making suggest that this separation can be  extraordinary difficult. The need to maximise quality of donated organs complicates dying experience of the donor and is likely in tension with the dying experience the patient envisioned when first considering MAiD. Furthermore, the idea that patients will think about MAiD first, and only when firmly decided to end their life, consider organ donation, runs contrary to organ donation policies in some countries as well as end of life and everyday decision making. This opens the door for organ donation to serve as an incentive in MAiD decisions. Dispensing with the simplistic assumption that organ donation can never be a factor in MAiD decisions is, therefore, essential first step to properly addressing ethical issues at hand.;;Buturovic Z;;eng;;['death', 'decision-making', 'donation/procurement of organs/tissues', 'euthanasia', 'transplantation'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2020-106456

1906;33199419;Article;2020;BMJ open;;Randomised sham-controlled double-blind trial evaluating remote ischaemic preconditioning in solid organ transplantation: a study protocol for the RIPTRANS trial.;;INTRODUCTION: Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) using a non-invasive pneumatic tourniquet is a potential method for reducing ischaemia-reperfusion injury. RIPC has been extensively studied in animal models and cardiac surgery, but scarcely in solid organ transplantation. RIPC could be an inexpensive and simple method to improve function of transplanted organs. Accordingly, we aim to  study whether RIPC performed in brain-dead organ donors improves function and longevity of transplanted organs. METHODS AND ANALYSES: RIPTRANS is a multicentre, sham-controlled, parallel group, randomised superiority trial comparing RIPC intervention versus sham-intervention in brain-dead organ donors scheduled to donate at least one kidney. Recipients of the organs (kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, lungs) from a randomised donor will be included provided that they give written informed consent. The RIPC intervention is performed by inflating a thigh tourniquet to 300 mm Hg 4 times for 5 min. The intervention is  done two times: first right after the declaration of brain death and second immediately before transferring the donor to the operating theatre. The sham group receives the tourniquet, but it is not inflated. The primary endpoint is delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney allografts. Secondary endpoints include short-term functional outcomes of transplanted organs, rejections and graft survival in various time points up to 20 years. We aim to show that RIPC reduces  the incidence of DGF from 25% to 15%. According to this, the sample size is set to 500 kidney transplant recipients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by Helsinki University Hospital Ethics Committee and Helsinki University Hospital's Institutional Review Board. The study protocol was be presented at the European Society of Organ Transplantation congress in Copenhagen 14-15 September 2019.

1909;33111409;Article;2020;Internal medicine journal;;Death, dying and donation: community perceptions of brain death and their relationship to decisions regarding withdrawal of vital organ support and organ donation.;;Despite brain death (BD) being established as a definition of death for over 50 years, the concept remains controversial. Little is known about public perception of death determination in decision-making about withdrawal of organ support and organ donation (OD), and the importance of the 'Dead Donor Rule' (DDR). We examined perceptions about death in a BD patient and their relationship to decisions about withdrawal of vital organ support, OD and the DDR, using an online survey of 1017 Australian adults. A BD patient scenario was presented, followed by a series of questions. Statistically significant differences in responses were determined using repeated measures analyses of variance and t tests. Seven hundred and fourteen respondents (70.2%) agreed that a hypothetical  BD patient was dead. Those disagreeing most commonly cited the presence of heartbeat and breathing. Seven hundred and seventy (75.7%) favoured removal of 'life support', including 136 (13.3%) who had not agreed the patient was dead. Support for OD was high, but most favoured organ removal only after heartbeat and breathing had ceased. Where OD was in keeping with the patient's known wishes, 464 (45.6%) agreed that organs could be removed even if this caused death. Forty-one (20%) of those who had indicated they considered the patient was not dead agreed to organ removal even if it caused death. Australian public views on  BD, withdrawal of 'life support' and OD are complex. Emphasis on prognosis and the impact of significant brain injury may be more appropriate in these situations, rather than focussing on death determination and upholding the DDR.;;Skowronski G, O'Leary MJ, Critchley C, O'Reilly L, Forlini C, Ghinea N, Sheahan L, Stewart C, Kerridge I;;eng;;['*brain death', '*ethics', '*intensive care', '*organ donation', '*transplantation'];;Sydney Medical School Foundation;10.1111/imj.15028
1910;33105200;Article;2020;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Ethical and societal challenges in penis transplantation.;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the current understanding of the ethical and societal difficulties of penile transplantation. RECENT FINDINGS: Penile transplantation, as with other forms of vascularized composite allotransplantation, has increasing acceptance in society but is still not entirely accepted. Guidelines aiming to help guide future penile transplant programs in an ethical and scientific safe manner were created. Controversies regarding the economic impact, patient safety, and the rights of the patients choosing penile transplant remains. SUMMARY: Penile transplantation has excellent functional and cosmetic results in the short-term and medium-term. The penis, similar to the face in facial transplantation, carries emotional gravity that relates to visible body parts of another that live forth in a tangible manner contributing to psychological and ethical challenges for both the individual and  society more broadly, healthcare administrators, and healthcare workers. In the context of these challenges, controversies emerge related to issues of judgment about what society can and wants to afford. Effects of toxic immunosuppression in a nonlife saving life-enhancing procedure, as well as costs, become arguments that have to be considered in the context of ethical and societal challenges.;;van der Merwe A, Moosa MR, Barsdorf N;;eng;;;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000820

1912;33033024;Article;2020;BMJ open;;Prospective single-centre clinical observational study on electronically monitored medication non-adherence, its psychosocial risk factors and lifestyle behaviours after heart transplantation: a study protocol.;;INTRODUCTION: In heart transplant recipients (HTRs), non-adherence (NA) to immunosuppressive (IS) medication and to recommended lifestyle behaviours are a common phenomenon and associated with higher risk of allograft rejection, organ loss and mortality. Risk factors for NA are highly diverse and still insufficiently researched. Precise measures of NA and an accurate understanding of its aetiology are of undisputable importance to detect patients at risk and intervene accordingly. The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy and concordance of different measures for NA as well as to determine potential risk factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre prospective observational  trial. HTRs who are at least aged 18 are no less than 6 months post-transplant and receive tacrolimus (Prograf or Advagraf), cyclosporine (Sandimmun) or everolimus (Certican) as their prescribed IS medication are eligible for participation. We only include patients during the phase of medication implementation. At study enrolment, we assess depression, health-related quality  of life, self-efficacy, social support, attachment, experiences and attitudes towards IS medication, emotional responses after transplantation, satisfaction with information about IS medication and perceptions and beliefs about medications. We further ask patients to rate their lifestyle behaviours concerning alcohol, smoking, diet, physical activity, sun protection and appointment keeping via questionnaires. Three different measurement methods for NA are applied at T0: self-reports, physician's estimates and IS trough levels. NA is monitored prospectively using an electronic multicompartment pillbox (MEMS, VAICA) over a 3-month period. Meanwhile, participants receive phone calls every second week to obtain additional self-reports, resulting in a total of seven measurement points. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Clinical Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Erlangen (Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nurnberg). Written informed consent is  attained from all participants. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences.

Intravenous (IV) contrast media use improves CT quality but may cause post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI). Retrospective studies show no association between reduced baseline renal function and IV contrast CT, but, to our knowledge, no data from randomised controlled trials exist. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The INCARO (INtravenous Contrast computed tomography versus native computed tomography in patients with acute Abdomen and impaired Renal functiOn) trial is a multicentre, open-label, parallel group, superiority, individually randomised controlled trial comparing IV contrast-enhanced CT to native CT in patients requiring emergency abdominal or body CT with impaired renal function defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy (RRT) within 90 days from CT. Secondary outcomes are AKI measured by KDIGO (The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria within 72 hours from CT, organ dysfunction defined by mSOFA (modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) criteria after 48 hours from CT, alive and hospital-free days within 90 days after CT, and time from imaging to definitive treatment. All-cause mortality, need for RRT and renal transplant in long-term follow-up are also measured. The calculated sample size is 994 patients. Patient recruitment is estimated to take 3 years.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis (registry data). SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Australia and New Zealand Liver  Transplant Registry data for all liver retransplantations in children (under 18 years of age), 1986-2017, in all four paediatric and six adult liver transplantation centres in the two countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Graft and patient survival at one, 5, 10 and 15 years. RESULTS: 142 liver retransplantations were undertaken in children (59 during 1986-2000, 83 during 2001-2017). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that survival was significantly greater during 2001-2017 than 1986-2000 (P < 0.001). During 2001-2017, graft survival one year after retransplantation was 84%, at 5 years 75%, at 10 years 70%, and at 15 years 54%; patient survival was 89% at one year,  87% at 5 years, 87% at 10 years, and 71% at 15 years. Median time between transplantations was 0.2 years (IQR, 0.03-1.4 years) during 1986-2000, and 1.8 years (IQR, 0.1-6.8 years) during 2001-2017 (P = 0.002). The proportion of graft  failures that involved split grafts was larger during 2001-2017 (35 of 83, 42%) than 1986-2000 (10 of 59, 17%). Graft type, cause of graft failure, and number of transplants did not influence survival following retransplantation. CONCLUSION: Survival for children following retransplantation is excellent. Graft survival is similar for split and whole grafts.

However, studies have differed on the choice of either deceased or living donors, with some centers even exploring both methods. As researchers continue to investigate the medical feasibility of these approaches, it is also important for the medical community to consider how deceased and living uterus donation differ ethically. We argue that if living and deceased donation demonstrate equivalent clinical efficacy and the deceased donor pool is sufficient, living uterus donation should be reevaluated and may no longer be ethically justifiable.;;Bruno B, Arora KS;;eng;;['*ethics', '*organ donation', '*uterus transplantation'];;;

An aging prison population translates to an older parolee population and increased incidence of kidney disease requiring either long-term dialysis or transplantation. This paper argues that due to challenges specific to the parolee population as well as societal biases and priorities, Transplant Centers and healthcare professionals face an ethical imperative to attend to the needs of parolees as a class and take steps to address challenges related to access to Centers for renal transplantation evaluation for this disadvantaged group. It will first review the regulatory context of kidney transplantation and highlight the specific ways it effects parolees. The paper will then discuss the broader social context of parolee reentry into society and barriers faced by parolees in this process. This ethical analysis examines the complexity of these issues, and deliberates on ways to balance the competing priorities of justice, respect for this patient population  as individuals and as a disadvantaged class, and the societal interests regarding organ allocation and considerable economic burdens of end-stage renal disease on  parolees, the justice system, and the public.;;Ahmad MU, Eves MM;;eng;;['*African American', '*Hispanic', '*access', '*dialysis', '*end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', '*ethics', '*kidney transplantation', '*parolees', '*social support'];;;10.1111/ctr.14104

It is not known if this differs between adult and pediatric programs, or by organ type. We performed an online, forced-choice survey of psychosocial listing criteria for adult and pediatric heart, kidney, liver, and lung transplant programs in the United States. Of 650 programs contacted, 343 (52.8%) submitted complete. A minority of programs had formal listing guidelines  for any condition considered (Down Syndrome, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Becker  Muscular Dystrophy, DiGeorge Syndrome, and Wolf Hirschhorn Syndrome; and mild [IQ < 70] and severe [IQ < 35] intellectual disability), although a majority had encountered most. Pediatric programs were significantly (P < .02) more lenient in the level of contraindication to listing for all genetic conditions considered except Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and for mild and severe intellectual disability. Level of contraindication differed significantly by organ type (heart, lung, liver, and kidney) for Duchenne Muscular dystrophy (P = <.001), Becker Muscular Dystrophy (P < .001), DiGeorge Syndrome (P < .001), Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (P = .0012), and severe intellectual disability (P < .001). There is significant variation among transplant programs in availability of guidelines for as well as listing practices regarding genetic diseases and intellectual disability, differing by both adult vs pediatric program, and organ  type.

On the social conditions of receiving an anonymous face transplant.;;In 2004, the French National Consultative Ethics Committee expressed strong misgivings about the proposal to include the face among body parts that can be removed from deceased donors for organ transplantation. Yet, the first face transplant was performed a few months later. How do medical teams and patients deal with the singular nature of the face? I argue that what the face represents  - from the medium of the donor's personal identity to an interchangeable organ -  is not fixed. It emerges through the practices and can evolve through the interactions between medical professionals and patients. In the postoperative time, I show that patients receive potentially contradictory recommendations about how to integrate the organ: to consider it theirs and forget the donor, but also to thank the donor for the donation and never forget the origin of the graft. Based on the plurality of relationships developed by the patients with their donor, I revisit Maussian interpretative analyses of organ reception. The effects of giving a face vary both in terms of reciprocity and identity: the feeling of debt is variably felt and can be interpreted negatively or positively, and the experience is more or less transformative.;;Le Clainche-Piel M;;eng;;['*anonymity', '*brain-dead donor', '*face', '*organ transplantation', '*policy'];;;10.1111/1467-9566.13178

Persistent microcirculatory abnormalities are associated with severity of organ dysfunction and mandate the development of bedside microcirculatory monitoring. A novel hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system can visualise changes in skin perfusion, oxygenation and water content at the bedside. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of HSI for bedside monitoring of skin microcirculation and the association of HSI parameters with organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis and major abdominal surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Three independent groups will be assessed and separately analysed within a clinical prospective observational study: (1) 25 patients with sepsis or septic shock (according to sepsis-3 criteria), (2) 25 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery and (3) 25 healthy controls. Patients with sepsis and patients undergoing pancreatic surgery will receive standard therapy according to local protocols derived from international guidelines. In addition, cardiac output of perioperative patients and patients with sepsis will be measured. Healthy controls undergo one standardised evaluation. The TIVITA Tissue System is a novel HSI system that uses the visible and near-infrared spectral light region to determine tissue microcirculatory parameters. HSI analysis (hand/knee) will be done in parallel to haemodynamic monitoring within defined intervals during a 72-hour observation period. HSI data will be correlated with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, global haemodynamics, inflammation and glycocalyx markers, surgical complications and 30-day outcome.

RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of SHL transplants is reviewed along with the outcomes of SHL transplants and their impact on the waitlist, particularly in the context of  solitary heart and liver transplantation. The ethical implications, most importantly the principles of utility and equity, of SHL transplant are addressed. In the context of utility, the distinction of a transplant being life-saving versus life-enhancing is investigated. The risk of hepatic decompensation for those awaiting both solitary and combined organ transplantation is an important consideration for the principle of equity. Lastly, the lack of standardization of programmatic approaches to SHL transplant  candidates, the national approach to allocation, and the criteria by which programs are evaluated are reviewed. SUMMARY: As with all multiorgan transplantation, SHL transplantation raises ethical issues of utility and equity. Given the unique patient population, good outcomes, lack of alternatives, and overall small numbers, we feel there is continued ethical justification for SHL,  but a more standardized nationwide approach to the evaluation, listing, and allocation of organs is warranted.;;Cheng XS, Wall A, Teuteberg J;;eng;['Decision Making/*ethics', 'Heart Transplantation/*ethics/methods', 'Humans', 'Liver Transplantation/*ethics/methods'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000806

METHODS: This qualitative research was conducted following the conventional content analysis method. The study population consisted of individuals with a history of brain death among their blood relatives who refused to donate the organs. Snowball sampling was employed to select the participants. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted for data gathering. Theoretical saturation was achieved through 20 interviews. Data analysis was done following the steps proposed by Graneheim and Lundman. Lincoln and Guba's criteria were used to ensure data rigor and transferability of the study. RESULTS: Data analyses revealed 185 codes, 23 categories, and seven themes including, poor knowledge about brain death and organ transplantation from a dead body, cultural beliefs, religious beliefs, deficiencies of requesting process, fear and concerns, inability to make a decision, and social learning. CONCLUSION: There were several factors in families' reluctance to donate organs of a brain-dead patient.

Transplant data (2013-2018) have been collected by the National Organ and Tissue  Transplant Organization from all states and union territories of India and submitted to the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation. From 2013 to 2018, 49155 transplants were reported in India, including 39000 living-donor organ recipients and 10 155 deceased-donor organ recipients. These transplants were for kidney (living donor = 32584, deceased donor = 5748), liver (living donor = 6416, deceased donor = 2967), heart (deceased donor = 895), lung (deceased donor = 459), pancreas (deceased donor = 78), and small bowel (deceased donor = 8). According to 2018 data, India was the second largest transplanting country in the world in terms of the absolute number of transplants. Here, we discuss the status, progress, challenges, and solutions for deceaseddonor organ transplantation. The plan to increase rates of organ donation in India include the following points: teamwork and focus by intensive care unit doctors; public education on organ donation using social media; professional education and family donation conversation programs for brain death declaration and donor management;  organ procurement organizations; international collaboration and regular meetings and updates for organizations working in the field of organ transplantation; grief counseling and reporting of potential donation for families of recently deceased people; nonfinancial incentivization to families of potential organ donors; expert committees and standard operating protocols for use of marginal donor organs, donation after circulatory death programs, and machine perfusion; maintenance of transparency and ethics in organ donation, allocation, and transplantation as directed by governmental, nongovernmental, and intergovernmental entities; and regular audit of progress and registry data.";;Kute V, Ramesh V, Shroff S, Guleria S, Prakash J;;eng;;;;;10.6002/ect.rlgnsymp2020.L6
1931;32756295;Article;2020;Journal of clinical medicine;;Living-Donor Uterus Transplantation: Pre-, Intra-, and Postoperative Parameters Relevant to Surgical Success, Pregnancy, and Obstetrics with Live Births.;;Uterus transplantation (UTx) can provide a route to motherhood for women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS), a congenital disorder characterized by uterovaginal aplasia, but with functional ovaries. Based on our  four successful living-donor transplantations and two resulting births, this analysis presents parameters relevant to standardizing recipient/donor selection, UTx surgery, and postoperative treatment, and their implementation in routine settings. We descriptively analyzed prospectively collected observational data from our four uterus recipients, all with MRKHS, their living donors, and the two newborns born to two recipients, including 1-year postnatal follow-ups. Analysis  included only living-donor/recipient pairs with completed donor/recipient surgery. Two recipients, both requiring ovarian restimulation under immunosuppression after missed pregnancy loss in one case and no pregnancy in the other, each delivered a healthy boy by cesarean section. We conclude that parameters crucial to successful transplantation, pregnancy, and childbirth include careful selection of donor/recipient pairs, donor organ quality, meticulous surgical technique, a multidisciplinary team approach, and comprehensive follow-up. Surgery duration and blood vessel selection await further optimization, as do the choice and duration of immunosuppression, which are crucial to timing the first embryo transfer.

1932;32755398;Article;2020;Disability and rehabilitation;;Growth through adversity: posttraumatic growth in anonymous living liver donors.;;PURPOSE: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is positive change that occurs after struggling with challenging life crises. Research on PTG has typically been limited to oncology populations, first-responders, and individuals in warzones. We report the experience of PTG amongst a sample of 26 anonymous live liver donors. METHODS: Anonymous donors were those with no biological connection or prior relationship with recipients. Twenty-six participants participated in a semi-structured qualitative interview examining their experience with, and outcomes of donation. Interview transcripts were analyzed for themes about PTG using the constant comparison method. RESULTS: While some donors indicated that donation had little lasting impact on their life, most cited significant personal and interpersonal changes resulting from the experience. The most common positive changes included deepened bonds with others, appreciation for personal strength,  clearer life direction, legacy-building, and a connection to the transplant community. CONCLUSION: Despite the short-term physical trauma of living donor surgery, the act of anonymous donation appeared to be a catalyst for positive long-term psychological growth. These findings help to bolster the ethical argument in favour of anonymous donation. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION There is a shortage of organ donors for recipients in need, and anonymous living liver  donors can successfully reduce wait times and mortality rates for those on wait lists. There are some questions about the ethics of anonymous donation due to possible negative physical and psychological effects of donation surgery on donors. In a qualitative study, this study shows that donors ascribe significant  meaning to, and derive many psychological benefits from, their donation experience. These findings provide insights about how to best support anonymous donors through and after their donation experience.;;Krause S, Pritlove C, Abbey S, Jung J;;eng;;['Post-traumatic growth', 'anonymous live liver donation', 'positive psychology', 'transplantation', 'trauma'];;;10.1080/09638288.2020.1802521

By analyzing the public media cases of Sarah Murnaghan, Amelia Rivera, and Riley Hancey, I assess whether public appeals to challenge inclusion and exclusion criteria for organ transplantation are ethical and under which circumstances. The issues of pediatric allocation with limited evidence and candidacy affected by factors such as intellectual disability and marijuana use are specifically discussed. Finally, I suggest that ethical public advocacy can coexist with well-evidenced transplant allocation if and when certain conditions (morally defensible criteria, expert evidence, nonprioritization of the poster child, and greater advocacy for organ transplantation in general) are met.;;Goldberg AM;;eng;['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystic Fibrosis/surgery', 'Directed Tissue Donation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Female', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lung Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Male', 'Online Social Networking', 'Parents', 'Patient Advocacy/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Pneumonia/surgery', 'Prejudice', 'Public Opinion', 'Resource Allocation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/organization & administration', 'Substance-Related Disorders', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/organization & administration', 'Waiting Lists', 'Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome/surgery', 'Young Adult'];;POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: The author has indicated she has no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.;;10.1542/peds.2020-0818J

Using the framework developed by Buchanan and Brock for surrogate decision-making, I examine what role the adolescent should morally play when deciding about therapy for life-threatening conditions. I argue that the greater  the efficacy of treatment, the less voice the adolescent (and the parent) should  have. I then consider how refusals of highly effective transplant cases are similar to and different from refusals of other lifesaving therapies (eg, chemotherapy for leukemia), which is more commonly discussed in the media and medical literature. I examine whether organ scarcity and the need for lifelong immunosuppression justify differences in whether the state intervenes when an adolescent and his or her parents refuse a transplant. I argue that the state, as parens patriae, has an obligation to provide the social supports needed for a successful transplant and follow-up treatment plan, although family refusals may  be permissible when the transplant is experimental or of low efficacy because of  comorbidities or other factors. I conclude by discussing the need to limit media  coverage of pediatric treatment refusals.;;Ross LF;;eng;['Adolescent', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent By Minors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Male', 'Mass Media/*ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Parental Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patient Participation', 'Patient Self-Determination Act', 'Principle-Based Ethics', 'Treatment Refusal/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Twins, Monozygotic', 'United Kingdom', 'United States'];;POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: The author has indicated she has no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.;;10.1542/peds.2020-0818H
1935;32732836;Article;2020;Transplantation;;Delayed Implantation of Pumped Kidneys Decreases Renal Allograft Futility in Combined Liver-Kidney Transplantation.;;"BACKGROUND: Combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT) improves survival for liver transplant recipients with renal dysfunction; however, the tenuous perioperative hemodynamic and metabolic milieu in high-acuity CLKT recipients increases delayed graft function and kidney allograft failure. We sought to analyze whether delayed KT through pumping would improve kidney outcomes following CLKT. METHODS: A retrospective analysis (University of California Los Angeles [n = 145], Houston Methodist Hospital [n = 79]) was performed in all adults receiving CLKT at 2 high-volume transplant centers from February 2004 to January 2017, and recipients were analyzed for patient and allograft survival as  well as renal outcomes following CLKT. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients (28.1%) underwent delayed implantation of pumped kidneys during CLKT (dCLKT) and 161 patients (71.9%) received early implantation of nonpumped kidneys during CLKT (eCLKT). Most recipients were high-acuity with median biologic model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of, 35 for dCLKT and 34 for eCLKT (P = ns). Pretransplant, dCLKT had longer intensive care unit stay, were more often intubated, and had greater vasopressor use. Despite this, dCLKT exhibited improved 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient and kidney survival (P = 0.02) and decreased  length of stay (P = 0.001), kidney allograft failure (P = 0.012), and dialysis duration (P = 0.031). This reduced kidney allograft futility (death or continued  need for hemodialysis within 3 mo posttransplant) for dCLKT (6.3%) compared with  eCLKT (19.9%) (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed implantation of pumped kidneys is associated with improved patient and renal allograft survival and decreased hospital length of stay despite longer kidney cold ischemia. These data should inform the ethical debate as to the futility of performing CLKT in high-acuity recipients.";;Lunsford KE, Agopian VG, Yi SG, Nguyen DTM, Graviss EA, Harlander-Locke MP, Saharia A, Kaldas FM, Mobley CM, Zarrinpar A, Hobeika MJ, Veale JL, Podder H, Farmer DG, Knight RJ, Danovitch GM, Gritsch HA, Li XC, Ghobrial RM, Busuttil RW, Gaber AO;;eng;['Aged', 'Allografts/immunology/supply & distribution', 'Cold Ischemia/instrumentation/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'End Stage Liver Disease/complications/*surgery', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/immunology', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects/ethics/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Liver Transplantation/*adverse effects/ethics/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Medical Futility/ethics', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Preservation/instrumentation/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Perfusion/instrumentation/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Renal Insufficiency/etiology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Time-to-Treatment/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/ethics/methods', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;K08 DK118187/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/TP.0000000000003040
1936;32732830;Article;2020;Transplantation;;Uncontrolled Donation After Circulatory Death: A Unique Opportunity.;;Uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) refers to donation from persons who die following an unexpected and unsuccessfully resuscitated cardiac arrest. Despite the large potential for uDCD, programs of this kind only exist in a reduced number of countries with a limited activity. Barriers to uDCD are of a  logistical and ethical-legal nature, as well as arising from the lack of confidence in the results of transplants from uDCD donors. The procedure needs to be designed to reduce and limit the impact of the prolonged warm ischemia inherent to the uDCD process, and to deal with the ethical issues that this practice poses: termination of advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, extension  of advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation beyond futility for organ preservation, moment to approach families to discuss donation opportunities, criteria for the determination of death, or the use of normothermic regional perfusion for the in  situ preservation of organs. Although the incidence of primary nonfunction and delayed graft function is higher with organs obtained from uDCD donors, overall patient and graft survival is acceptable in kidney, liver, and lung transplantation, with a proper selection and management of both donors and recipients. Normothermic regional perfusion has shown to be critical to achieve optimal outcomes in uDCD kidney and liver transplantation. However, the role of ex situ preservation with machine perfusion is still to be elucidated. uDCD is a  unique opportunity to improve patient access to transplantation therapies and to  offer more patients the chance to donate organs after death, if this is consistent with their wishes and values.;;Coll E, Minambres E, Sanchez-Fructuoso A, Fondevila C, Campo-Canaveral de la Cruz JL, Dominguez-Gil B;;eng;['Allografts/supply & distribution', 'Donor Selection/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods', 'Graft Rejection/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Arrest/*mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Organ Preservation/*methods', 'Organ Transplantation/adverse effects/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence/*methods', 'Perfusion/instrumentation/methods', 'Resuscitation/ethics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Warm Ischemia/adverse effects'];;;;10.1097/TP.0000000000003139

While other countries (eg, UK, Australia and Belgium) have explored and implemented alternative models of transplantation, such as cardiac donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) to alleviate transplantation wait times, ethical concerns have hindered implementation in some countries. This study aims to explore the attitudes and opinions of healthcare providers and the public about cardiac DCDD in order to identify and describe opportunities and challenges in ensuring that proposed cardiac DCDD procedures in Canada are consistent with Canadian values and ethical norms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will include two parts that will be conducted concurrently.  Part 1 is a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews with Canadian healthcare providers who routinely care for organ donors and/or transplant recipients to describe their perceptions about cardiac DCDD. Part 2 is a convergent parallel mixed-methods design consisting of a series of focus groups and follow-up surveys with members of the Canadian general public to describe their perceptions about cardiac DCDD.

We aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude towards organ donation in adolescents in Austria and Switzerland. METHODS: A paper-based survey was performed in two secondary schools (age range 11-20 years) in Austria and Switzerland. 354/400 surveys were sufficiently answered and analyzed. RESULTS: Our study found that knowledge on organ donation is scarce in  adolescents. Less than 60% of those surveyed thinks that a person is dead when declared brain dead. 84.6% would authorize organ donation after brain death for themselves, but only 69% would authorize organ donation after brain death for a close relative. 93.7% would accept a donor organ if they needed one. Family discussions, rather than school discussions, influenced knowledge on organ donation, the percentage of respondents who have a firm opinion on organ donation and the rate of declaration of this opinion. Age, gender, nationality and religion also influenced knowledge and attitude towards organ donation. Nearly one third of adolescents are of the opinion that selling non-vital organs should  be legalized. CONCLUSION: Since having had family discussions, a potentially modifiable factor, was positively associated with knowledge and attitude towards  organ donation, we postulate that educational programs stimulating family discussions on organ donation may be a promising strategy to increase knowledge.;;Stadlbauer V, Zink C, Likar P, Zink M;;eng;;['*Adolescent', '*Attitude', '*Education', '*High school', '*Organ donation'];;;10.1186/s12910-020-00499-x

Xenotransplantation has the potential to offer unlimited availability of pig organs for transplantation, and pig-to-non-human primate models have demonstrated outcomes that may soon justify clinical trials. However, one of the unique ethical challenges faced by xenotransplantation is that the risk of introducing potential zoonotic disease into the community must be weighed along with the benefit to the patient. While most experts believe that zoonosis is manageable, apprehension over disease transmission from animal donors to human recipients remains a frequent concern of many who are undecided or opposed to clinical xenotransplantation. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a scenario (rapid worldwide spread of a highly contagious novel zoonotic disease with no natural defense in humans) that would seem to justify apprehension, especially in the United States, which has largely avoided previous pandemic outbreaks. However, there are many differences between zoonosis found in the wild or after xenotransplantation that  favor the safety of the latter. Still, these differences, as well as the benefits of xenotransplantation, are not widely understood outside of the field.

We review the medical criteria for uterus transplantation, discuss the additional options for parenthood in same-sex couples, examine how to determine if this meets the criteria of just distribution of uterus grafts, and ultimately argue that the value of gestation is at the level of the individual rather than the couple.;;Testa G, Johannesson L, Wall AE;;eng;['Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics', 'Pregnancy', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', '*Uterus/transplantation'];;;;
1947;32571701;Article;2020;Transplantation proceedings;;Donor Klotho KL-VS Polymorphism Predicts Allograft Glomerulosclerosis and Early Post-Transplant Kidney Function.;;"BACKGROUND: The Klotho protein, encoded by the KL (Klotho) gene, exerts antiaging and antifibrotic effects. The KL-VS genotype diminishes Klotho expression and correlates with cardiovascular death, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease progression. The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of donor Klotho rs9536314 and rs9527025 polymorphisms (KL-VS genotype) to renal allograft  morphology and function in the early post-transplant period. METHODS: Clinical data and biopsy reports of 170 deceased donor transplantations were retrieved from standard medical files. Donor DNA was genotyped for rs9527025 and rs9536314  SNPs using custom TaqMan assays. RESULTS: As rs9527025 remained in full linkage with rs9536314, we report results for the latter. The analyses were performed for G dominant model (GG+GT vs TT). We found an association between reported SNP alleles, morphologic changes in the peritransplant biopsy, and kidney function 3  months after engraftment. A chronic glomerulopathy score of >0 was found in 12.2% of GG+GT cases and in 3.2% of TT cases (P = .023). For G allele carriers, the third month's median estimated glomerular filtration rate value was 35.0 (range,  20.4-76.6 mL/min), while for TT haplotype, the value was 46.3 (range, 15.5-96.8 mL/min), P = .001. At the third post-transplant month, proteinuria incidence was  higher for organs with G allele than with TT haplotype (24.4% vs 9.5%; P = .030;  odds ratio 3.09; 95% confidence interval 1.22-7.69). CONCLUSION: Deceased donor KL-VS polymorphism, altering protein dimerization and coreceptor function, predicts early renal transplant glomerular lesions and function. Further analyses for mentioned effect durability are necessary. ETHICS STATEMENT: This study complies with the Helsinki Congress and the Istanbul Declaration regarding donor  source.

In general, these systems do not take into account the fact that this definition is being heavily criticized and the far-reaching consequences thereof. In the case of organ transplantation, vital organs are procured from persons who, from a biological perspective, may not yet be dead. A government that values scientific data and wants to provide honest and reliable information to its citizens has to account for this critique of its policy as citizens have the right to be well-informed. Whoever makes the decision to donate organs performs a special act of human solidarity, but the readiness to donate organs in the case of brain death is not  inherent to the demand to love one's neighbor as one loves oneself. Summary: According to legislation on organ donation in many countries, a brain-dead patient is regarded as a mortal remains. The law disregards the fact, however, that this definition is being heavily criticized and that it has far-reaching consequences. In the case of organ transplantation, vital organs are procured from persons who, from a biological perspective, may not yet been dead.

The family attitudes of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) play an important role in advocating organ transplantation and donation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the family attitudes of patients with ESRD toward living kidney donation in China. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Linyi People's Hospital. This study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This research was performed at 5 third-level hospitals with hemodialysis and nephrology departments, and a small section comes from urology departments. The participants were surveyed from January to November 2018. Attitudes were evaluated using a validated questionnaire concerning the psychosocial aspects of organ donation. The self-administered questionnaire was completed anonymously. Statistical analyses employed t tests and the chi(2) test. RESULTS: Regarding living kidney donation,  69.1% (n = 428) of patient families favored it; however, only 30.9% (n = 192) did not support it. A favorable attitude toward living donation was mainly associated with the following variables: 1. the recipient is not more than 50 years old; 2.  the recipient is a member of the immediate family; 3. the living donation is from the recipient's family member; 4. the family has previous personal experience with organ transplantation and donation; and 5. the family has a concern about the possibility of needing a transplant within the family unit (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Economic burden and mental stress from long-term dialysis influenced the attitudes and behavioral intentions of the families of patients with ESRD on  advocating organ donation. Repeated education and constant advocacy are advised to increase the participation of families of patients with ESRD in organ donation. The results showed favorable attitudes toward living kidney donation among the families of patients with ESRD.";;Zhang Z, Yuan X, Wu Y, Guo F, Tian J;;eng;['Adult', 'China', 'Family/*psychology', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic', 'Kidney Transplantation/*psychology', 'Living Donors/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.03.025

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the impact of the new policy on the treatment practices of transplant centers. METHODS: Initial listing data on all adult heart candidates listed from December 1, 2017 to April 30, 2019 were collected from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. The status-qualifying treatments (or exception requests) and hemodynamic values at listing of a post-policy cohort (December 2018 to April 2019) were compared with  a seasonally matched pre-policy cohort (December 2017 to April 2018). Candidates  in the pre-policy cohort were reclassified into the new priority system statuses  by using treatment, diagnosis, and hemodynamics. RESULTS: Comparing the post-policy cohort (N = 1,567) with the pre-policy cohort (N = 1,606), there were significant increases in listings with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (+1.2%), intra-aortic balloon pumps (+ 4 %), and exceptions (+ 12%). Listings with low-dose inotropes (-18%) and high-dose inotropes (-3%) significantly decreased. The new priority status distribution had more status 2 (+14%) candidates than expected and fewer status 3 (-5%), status 4 (- 4%) and status 6 (-8%) candidates than expected (p values <0.01 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of the new heart allocation policy, transplant centers listed more candidates with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intra-aortic balloon pumps, and exception requests and fewer candidates with inotrope therapy  than expected, thus leading to significantly more high-priority status listings than anticipated. If these early trends persist, the new allocation system may not function as intended.";;Parker WF, Chung K, Anderson AS, Siegler M, Huang ES, Churpek MM;;eng;['Adult', 'Cardiotonic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/*therapy', '*Heart Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', '*Waiting Lists'];['*allocation', '*ethics', '*heart transplantation'];;K08 HL150291/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1016/j.jacc.2020.01.066

Sixty percent  of patients with mild and poor-risk factors need additional treatments. Starting  in 1980s, high dose chemotherapy regimens (HDCT) that were not applicable before  due to hematological toxicity have been brought into use, and survival and cure possibility have increased. To date, no randomized trial has been conducted to demonstrate superiority of high-dose chemotherapy protocols used for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Our study aims to compare two commonly used HDCT regimens for a long period, with real-life data. METHODS: Approval for thiss retrospective study was obtained from the ethics committee of Gulhane Training and Research Hospital. Fifty refractory testicular cancer patients above 18 years were treated with HDCT and ASCT at Gulhane Training and Research Hospital (January 2011-July 2018). RESULTS: Fifty metastatic, refractory testicular carcinoma patients with a median age of 34 were included in the study. Ninety per cent of the cases had stage III disease at diagnosis. Except for 8 patients (16%) at mild risk group, all the other patients were at high risk. CE was used as salvage treatment for half of the patients and ICE was used for the other half. Four patients responded completely and 30 responded partially to ASCT. Post transplantation median progression-free survival (PFS) was 22 months. Median overall survival (OS) in the general population was 223.4 months (76.1-370.7). Although there was a difference in OS between chemotherapy groups, the difference was not statistically significant. The mean duration of engraftment in patients treated with CE was 11.2 +/- 2.3 days, while in patients receiving ICE it was 15.5 +/- 2.1 days. This difference between chemotherapy groups was statistically  significant (p<0.001).;;Yildiz B, Pinar Aral I, Balyemez U, Esin E, Erturk I, Acar R, Karadurmus N;;eng;['Adult', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*methods'];;;;

We also assessed whether these outcomes differed in high and low competition centers, as defined by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Following DSA removal, there was a 9-day decrease in  median waitlist time (P = .001) and an increase in median lung allocation score (40 vs 42, P < .0001) but no difference in the need for pretransplant ECMO (incidence rate ratio = 1.16, P = .12). Median LOS increased from 17 to 19 days in the post-DSA era (P = .01). There was no difference in posttransplant outcomes, including prolonged ventilation, new dialysis, or early survival, in the general cohort or between competition groups. High competition centers saw an 18.5-minute increase in ischemic time compared to low competition centers (P = .04) but did not differentially increase single lung transplants or pretransplant ECMO utilization. Overall, DSA elimination was associated with increased posttransplant LOS but no significant differences in pretransplant ECMO or other  posttransplant outcomes.

Secondary objectives  are to determine the effects of MSCs on important clinical outcomes, as described below. TRIAL DESIGN: REALIST COVID 19 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple blinded trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units  in hospitals across the United Kingdom. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS as  defined by the Berlin definition, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical diagnosis or PCR test will be eligible. Patients will be excluded for the following reasons: more than 72 hours from the onset of ARDS; age < 16 years; patient known to be pregnant; major trauma in previous 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer); WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; venous thromboembolism currently receiving anti-coagulation or within the past 3 months; patient receiving extracorporeal life support; severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh > 12); Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; prisoners; declined consent; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; previously enrolled in the REALIST trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Allogeneic donor CD362  enriched human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stromal cells (REALIST ORBCEL-C) supplied as sterile, single-use cryopreserved cell suspension of a fixed dose of 400 x10(6) cells in 40ml volume, to be diluted in Plasma-Lyte 148 to a total volume of 200mls for administration. Comparator (placebo): Plasma-Lyte 148 Solution for Infusion (200mls). The cellular product (REALIST ORBCEL-C) was developed and patented by Orbsen Therapeutics. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary safety  outcome is the incidence of serious adverse events. The primary efficacy outcome  is Oxygenation Index (OI) at day 7. Secondary outcomes include: OI at days 4 and  14; respiratory compliance, driving pressure and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (PF ratio) at days 4, 7 and 14; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at days 4, 7 and 14; extubation and reintubation; ventilation free days at day 28; duration of mechanical ventilation; length of ICU and hospital stay; 28-day and 90-day mortality. RANDOMISATION: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomised via a centralised automated 24-hour telephone or web-based randomisation system (CHaRT, Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials, University  of Aberdeen). Randomisation will be stratified by recruitment centre and by vasopressor use and patients will be allocated to REALIST ORBCEL-C or placebo control in a 1:1 ratio. BLINDING (MASKING): The investigator, treating physician, other members of the site research team and participants will be blinded. The cell therapy facility and clinical trials pharmacist will be unblinded to facilitate intervention and placebo preparation. The unblinded individuals will keep the treatment information confidential. The infusion bag will be masked at the time of preparation and will be administered via a masked infusion set. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A sample size of 60 patients with 30 patients randomised to the intervention and 30 to the control group. If possible, recruitment will continue beyond 60 patients to provide more accurate and definitive trial results. The total number of patients recruited will depend on the pandemic and be guided by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC). TRIAL STATUS: REALIST Phase 1 completed in January 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an open label dose escalation study of REALIST ORBCEL-C in patients with ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic emerged as REALIST Phase 2 was planned  to commence and the investigator team decided to repurpose the Phase 2 trial as a COVID-19 specific trial. This decision was discussed and approved by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and DMEC. Submissions were made to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and MHRA to amend the protocol to a COVID-19 specific patient population and the protocol amendment was accepted by the REC on 27(th) March 2020 and MHRA on 30(th) March 2020 respectively. Other protocol changes in this amendment included an increase in the time of onset of ARDS from 48 to 72 hours,  inclusion of clinical outcomes as secondary outcomes, the provision of an option  for telephone consent, an indicative sample size and provision to continue recruitment beyond this indicative sample size. The current protocol in use is version 4.0 23.03.2020 (Additional file 1). Urgent Public Health status was awarded by the NIHR on 2 April 2020 and the trial opened to recruitment and recruited the first participant the same day.

1960;32454041;Article;2020;Journal of hepatology;;An international multicenter study of protocols for liver transplantation during  a pandemic: A case for quadripartite equipoise.;;"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The outbreak of COVID-19 has vastly increased the operational  burden on healthcare systems worldwide. For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an  urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation  against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multicenter study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the quadripartite equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to  liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium-sized liver transplant centers from 12 countries across 4 continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity  in response to the pandemic, favoring a ""sickest-first"" approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - recipient outcome, donor/graft safety, waiting list mortality and healthcare resources - for 7 countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in  the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS:  This four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems. LAY SUMMARY: There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe a four-dimensional model of quadripartite equipoise that models these ethical tensions and can guide the regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems.";;Chew CA, Iyer SG, Kow AWC, Madhavan K, Wong AST, Halazun KJ, Battula N, Scalera I, Angelico R, Farid S, Buchholz BM, Rotellar F, Chan AC, Kim JM, Wang CC, Pitchaimuthu M, Reddy MS, Soin AS, Derosas C, Imventarza O, Isaac J, Muiesan P, Mirza DF, Bonney GK;;eng;['Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology', '*End Stage Liver Disease/mortality/surgery', 'Health Resources/*trends', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', '*Liver Transplantation/ethics/methods', 'Organizational Innovation', '*Pandemics/ethics/prevention & control', 'Patient Selection/ethics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/organization & administration/trends', 'Waiting Lists/mortality'];['*COVID-19', '*Equipoise', '*Ethics', '*Liver transplantation'];Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest that pertain to this work.

Given the scarcity of deceased donor organs, transplantation programs state that patient promises of compliance cannot be taken at face value and exclude candidates deemed untrustworthy. This article argues that transplant programs frequently lack the data to make this utilitarian calculation accurately, with the result that, in practice, the psychosocial evaluation of potential transplant candidates is discriminatory and unfair. Historically excluded candidates, such as patients suffering from alcohol use, have turned out to benefit highly from transplantation. Transplant programs should tend to trust patients when they claim to be good potential organ stewards, thereby respecting patient autonomy, advancing justice, and saving more lives.;;Parker WF, Chin MH;;eng;;;;K08 HL150291/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1001/amajethics.2020.408

The original type of organ donation from deceased patients was controlled donation after circulatory death, previously referred to as non-heart beating organ donation. The rise of donation after circulatory death in the UK came about through advances in critical care and transplant medicine and support from several key organisations  in developing a robust ethical, legal and professional framework. The transplant  waiting list reached a historic peak in 2009-2010 of 8000 patients, but fell by 25% to 6000 in 2017-2018. There has also been a steady rise in the number of deceased donors and the number of donations after circulatory death. The contribution of donation after circulatory death to the total number of donations rose steadily between 2000 and 2012 and has remained about 40% since.

1963;32424063;Article;2020;Journal of medical ethics;;Triage during the COVID-19 epidemic in Spain: better and worse ethical arguments.;;"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an imbalance between the clinical needs of the population and the effective availability of advanced life support (ALS) resources. Triage protocols have thus become necessary. Triage decisions in situations of scarce resources were not extraordinary in the pre-COVID-19 era; these protocols abounded in the context of organ transplantation. However, this prior experience was not considered during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. Lacking national guidance or public coordination, each hospital has been forced to put forth independent and autonomous triage protocols, most of which were, nonetheless, based on common ethical principles and clinical criteria. However, controversial, non-clinical criteria have also been defended by Spanish scientific societies and public institutions, including setting an age cut-off value for unilaterally withholding ALS, using 'social utility' criteria, prioritising healthcare professionals or using 'first come, first served' policies. This paper describes the most common triage criteria used in the Spanish context during the COVID-19 epidemic. We will highlight our missed opportunities by comparing these criteria to those used in organ transplantation  protocols. The problems posed by subjective, non-clinical criteria will also be discussed. We hope that this critical review might be of use to countries at earlier stages of the epidemic while we learn from our mistakes.";;Herreros B, Gella P, Real de Asua D;;eng;['Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical Protocols/standards', 'Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Health Care Rationing/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Organ Transplantation/ethics/standards', 'Pandemics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Spain', 'Triage/*ethics'];['*allocation of health care resources', '*applied and professional ethics', '*clinical ethics', '*decision-making', '*distributive justice'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2020-106352
1964;32418979;Article;2020;Ui sahak;;Religious Myths and their Historical Heritage: How did Saints Cosmas and Damian become Patron Saints of Surgery? - From the Miracle of the Black Legs to 21st Century Transplant Medicine - .;;"This paper explores the heritage and the essential significance of worship of the twin Christian saints -St. Cosmas and St. Damian- in the history of medicine. These saints are well known in Western culture as one of the leading Christian saints to heal diseases, whose cults have spread to Europe through Byzantium, which have continued to spread widely to the present, starting from areas where Christianity had been proselytized. Although it is true that their life journeys  have undergone many processes of embellishment and beautification over the course of time, the attributes that distinctively characterize the two saints exist apart from such mythical fabrications. This paper categorizes the characteristics of the two saints as being those of ""professional doctors,"" ""ideal doctors,"" and  ""holders of healing powers"" as intermediaries of God, examining how these characteristics came to affect various medical organizations during the era when  Medieval medicine was gradually transitioning toward a rational approach based on reason. In addition, it discusses how some of the practices of ancient temple medicine were transplanted into the Christian culture, the process by which it finally arrived at human doctors through the two saints, and how it affected the  establishment of professional work ethics -albeit in nascent form- as their medical ethics came to be accepted and practiced by the Medieval guild of surgeons. Furthermore, the paper considers how the existence of the two saints has acquired symbolism in modern medicine, which has made remarkable progress in  organ transplantation, and in particular, how it constitutes a significant part of the history of organ transplantation. It is not easy to objectify and attach meaning to an era that was substantially influenced by myths, legends, or religious events. This is because it is easy to fall into the trap of simplifying and passing judgment on the past based on the realities of the present day, without making efforts to understand the unique circumstances and contexts of the past. This is especially the case when the distinction between ""religious events"" and ""medical events"" is ambiguous, or when dealing with a social culture where religious influence was paramount. From a broader perspective, the study of St. Cosmas and St. Damian is not concerned with the rights or wrongs of religious myths amid the advancement of medicine and its adherence to science and reason, but with the attempt at a deep and broad understanding of human diseases and human conditions of being prone to such diseases throughout life.";;Soh JS;;eng;['*Attitude', 'General Surgery/*history', 'History, 15th Century', 'History, 16th Century', 'History, 17th Century', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'History, Ancient', 'History, Medieval', 'Mythology/*history', 'Organ Transplantation/*psychology', 'Saints/*history'];['Anargyroi', 'Confrerie Saint Come', 'Golden Legend', 'Guild', 'Miracle of the Black Leg', 'Transplantation medicine', 'Saints Cosmas and Damian'];;Ministry of Education;10.13081/kjmh.2020.29.165
1965;32409223;Article;2020;Transplantation proceedings;;Quality System of Kidney Donation for Transplantation From Living Donors in Poland.;;"OBJECTIVE: The program aims to build and develop a high-quality donation system at the hospital and national level. Thirty coordinator posts for the transplantation of kidneys from living donors (LDs) were created. The coordinators' tasks were identified as determining or excluding the possibility of LD donation for kidney transplantation for every potential kidney recipient referred to the waiting list, qualifying potential LDs, supervising health monitoring for LDs and kidney recipients, and education and promotion of transplantation from LDs. METHODS: The coordinators' reports and verification of  data in the national transplant register from June 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019 were analyzed. ETHICS: The study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Declaration of Istanbul participation was on a voluntary basis. RESULTS: Information on possible LDs was obtained from 707 (43%) of the 1630 potential recipients entered on the waiting list. In 373 cases there  was no potential LD; 16 recipients did not give consent for kidney transplantation from a LD; for 318 recipients, 340 potential LDs were identified; 90 potential LDs were rejected at the initial stage for medical reasons; 60 potential donors were rejected at further stages of the qualification process; 3  persons resigned from donation; and 23 recipients were transplanted from deceased donors. Kidneys from 73 LDs were qualified and transplanted. On November 30, 2019, 91 potential donors were awaiting further qualification. As part of the program, 27 potential pairs for paired kidney exchange were reported to Poltransplant (17 pairs with positive HLA crossmatch, 10 with incompatible blood  groups). CONCLUSIONS: The creation of posts for coordinators for LD kidney transplantation in centers that qualify for LD kidney transplantation enabled systematic monitoring of donation potential, which led to an increase in the number of LD kidney transplants in 2019. Making full use of donation potential should significantly increase these numbers in the coming years.";;Hermanowicz M, Borczon S, Lewandowska D, Przygoda J, Podobinska I, Danielewicz R, Malanowski P, Kaminski A, Czerwinski J;;eng;['Female', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors/*supply & distribution', 'Male', 'Poland', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*organization & administration'];;;;10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.01.115

In this article, we critically examine the available data on the risk of transmission of  SARS-CoV-2 through organ transplantation. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from nonlung clinical specimens, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsy specimens, previous experience with the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the vast experience with other common RNA respiratory viruses are all addressed. Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart. Other considerations including ethical, financial,  societal, and logistical concerns are also addressed. We conclude that, for selected patients with high waitlist mortality, transplant programs should consider accepting heart or liver transplants from deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection.;;Kates OS, Fisher CE, Rakita RM, Reyes JD, Limaye AP;;eng;['Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*prevention & control/*transmission', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Heart/virology', 'Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/trends', 'Humans', 'Liver/virology', 'Liver Transplantation/adverse effects/trends', 'Lung/virology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Pandemics/*prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*prevention & control/*transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome/prevention & control', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/ethics/*standards/*trends', 'Waiting Lists'];['donors and donation: deceased', 'donors and donation: donor-derived infections', 'editorial/personal viewpoint', 'ethics', 'ethics and public policy', 'infection and infectious agents - viral', 'infectious disease', 'organ acceptance', 'organ procurement and allocation', 'organ transplantation in general'];;K23 HL143050/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1111/ajt.16000

1968;32376754;Article;2020;BMJ open;;Prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of ischaemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT) in the treatment of end-stage liver disease.;;INTRODUCTION: During conventional liver transplantation (CLT), ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is inevitable and is associated with complications such as early allograft dysfunction (EAD), primary non-function and ischaemic-type biliary lesions. We have established a novel procedure called ischaemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT). The results from a pilot study suggest that IFLT might prevent IRI and yield better transplant outcomes than CLT. The purpose of this study was to further assess the efficacy and safety of IFLT versus CLT in patients with end-stage liver disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an investigator-initiated, open-label, phase III, prospective, single-centre randomised controlled trial on the effects of IFLT in patients with end-stage liver disease. Adult patients (aged 18-75 years) eligible for liver transplantation will be screened for participation in this trial and will be randomised between the IFLT group (n=34) and the CLT group (n=34). In the IFLT group, the donor liver will be procured, preserved and implanted with continuous  normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). In the CLT group, the donor liver will be procured after a fast cold flush, preserved in 0 degrees C-4 degrees C solution and implanted under hypothermic and hypoxic conditions. Patients in both groups will be managed according to the standard protocol of our centre. The primary end point is the incidence of EAD after liver transplantation. Intraoperative and postoperative parameters of donor livers and recipients will be observed and recorded, and postoperative liver graft function, complications and recipient and graft survival will be evaluated. After a 12-month follow-up of the last enrolled recipient, the outcomes will be analysed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFLT versus CLT in patients with end-stage liver disease. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of  The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The findings will be disseminated to the public through conference presentations and peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Cited barriers include lack of knowledge about the potential donor pool, lack of robust outcomes data, lack of standard donor eligibility criteria and preservation methods, and logistical and ethical challenges. To determine whether it would be appropriate to invest in addressing these barriers and building this practice, we sought to enumerate the potential pool of uDCD donors. Using data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, the largest all-payer emergency department (ED) database, between 2013 and 2016, we identified patients who had refractory cardiac arrest in the ED. We excluded patients with contraindications to both deceased donation (including infection, malignancy, cardiopulmonary disease) and  uDCD (including hemorrhage, major polytrauma, burns, and poisoning). We identified 9828 (range: 9454-10 202) potential uDCDs/y; average age was 32 years, and all were free of major comorbidity. Of these, 91.1% had traumatic deaths, with major causes including nonhead blunt injuries (43.2%) and head injuries (40.1%).

Despite this, organ failure and the need for transplant continues  throughout the United States. Considering the perpetual scarcity of deceased donor organs, Kates et al present a viewpoint that advocates for the utilization  of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive donors in selected cases. We present a review of the current literature that details the potential negative consequences of COVID-19-positive donors. The factors we consider include (1) the risk of blood transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) involvement of donor organs, (3) lack of effective therapies, (4) exposure of health care and recovery teams, (5)  disease transmission and propagation, and (6) hospital resource utilization. While we acknowledge that transplant fulfills the mission of saving lives, it is  imperative to consider the consequences not only to our recipients but also to the community and to health care workers, particularly in the absence of effective preventative or curative therapies. For these reasons, we believe the evidence and risks show that COVID-19 infection should continue to remain a contraindication for donation, as has been the initial response of donation and transplant societies.;;Shah MB, Lynch RJ, El-Haddad H, Doby B, Brockmeier D, Goldberg DS;;eng;['*Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*prevention & control/*transmission', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects/*trends', 'Pandemics/*prevention & control', 'Personal Protective Equipment', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*prevention & control/*transmission', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'United States'];['donors and donation', 'editorial/personal viewpoint', 'ethics and public policy', 'infection and infectious agents - viral', 'infectious disease', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement', 'organ procurement and allocation', 'organ transplantation in general'];;;10.1111/ajt.15969

Concerns have been raised that GKE violates the nonpayment principle, exploits donors in low- and middle-income countries, and detracts from the aim of self-sufficiency. We review the arguments for and against GKE. We argue that while some concerns about GKE are justified based on the available evidence, others are speculative and do not apply exclusively to GKE but to living donation more generally. We posit that concerns can be mitigated by implementing safeguards, by developing minimum quality criteria and by establishing an international committee that independently monitors and evaluates GKE's procedures and outcomes. Several questions remain however that warrant further clarification. What are the experiences and views of recipients and donors participating in GKE? Who manages the escrow funds that have been put in place for donor and recipients? What procedures and safeguards have been put in place to prevent corruption of these funds? What are the inclusion criteria for participating GKE centers? GKE provides opportunity to promote access to donation and transplantation but can only be conducted with the appropriate safeguards.

As programs make the transition from a standard approach to a resource-constrained approach to transplantation, we utilize a framework for ethical decisions in settings of absolutely scarce resources to help guide programs in deciding which patients to transplant, which donors to accept, how to minimize risk, and how to ensure the best utilization of transplant team members.;;Wall AE, Pruett T, Stock P, Testa G;;eng;['*Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Health Care Rationing/*organization & administration', 'Health Resources/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Organ Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pandemics', 'Patient Selection', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*epidemiology', 'Resource Allocation/*methods', 'SARS-CoV-2'];['*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*infection and infectious agents - viral', '*infectious disease', '*organ acceptance', '*organ allocation', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*organ transplantation in general', '*patient safety'];;;10.1111/ajt.15914

In fact, there has been increased industrial farm meat production and biotechnological experimentation. Xenotransplantation trials, for example, are being heralded ""the answer"" to organ shortages needed for human transplantation, while significant ethical concerns persist. In this paper, I posit that literary reflections add a valuable dimension to animal ethics deliberations, providing a meta-narrative against which to assess normative practices. Beginning with synopses of three books: E.B. White's Charlotte's Web (1952), Robert Newton Peck's A Day No Pigs Would Die (1972), and Paul Griffin's Saving Marty (2017), I illustrate a shifting moral status view of human-pig relationships.

1988;32242345;Article;2020;Journal of Korean medical science;;Recent Decrease in Organ Donation from Brain-Dead Potential Organ Donors in Korea and Possible Causes.;;"BACKGROUND: In 1999, the Organ Transplantation Act legalized organ donation from  brain-dead patients. As a result of the government's continued efforts, the number of brain-dead donors steadily increased from 2002 through 2016. However, the number has declined since 2017. This paper examined the possible reasons behind the decline in brain-dead organ donation. METHODS: This investigation was  an analysis of published data from the Korea Organ Donation Agency annual reports from 2013 to 2018. RESULTS: The number of brain-dead organ donors in Korea rose steadily until 2016, declined in 2017 for the first time since 2002, and then dropped sharply in 2018. Although the number of brain-dead potential organ donors increased between 2017 and 2018, the number of eligible donors decreased, suggesting that patient families rejected the brain-death determination process and brain-dead organ donation. Statistics gathered during identification of brain-dead potential donors and actual donations confirm that rejection or withdrawal of consent by the family has increased. During the same period when donation from brain- dead patients decreased, five events occurred: 1) compensation for donor families was abolished; 2) an incident of mistreatment of  a brain-dead donor's remains occurred; 3) the Life-Sustaining Treatment Act was enacted, providing a legal procedure whereby families of brain-dead patients could forgo life-sustaining treatment; 4) residents' work week was limited to 80  hours; and 5) the Labor Standards Law was amended. CONCLUSION: Fewer eligible donors in spite of an increase in brain-dead potential organ donors suggests that reduction in these donations resulted mainly from factors associated with family  consent. Among such factors, implementation of the Life-sustaining Treatment Act  appears to be most important. Abolition of family compensation and the incident in which a brain-dead donor's remains were mistreated may also have influenced family consent.";;Park J, Kim CJ;;eng;['Brain Death', 'Eligibility Determination', '*Family', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', '*Organ Transplantation', 'Republic of Korea', '*Tissue Donors', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement/trends'];['Brain Death', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Transplantation'];The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.;;10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e94

The practice is playing an increasingly important role within the transplant programme in the United Kingdom, where these donors are commonly used to trigger a chain of transplants; thereby amplifying the benefit derived from their donation. The initial reluctance to accept UKD was in part due to uncertainty about donor motivations and whether the practice was morally and ethically acceptable. OBJECTIVES: This article provides an overview of UKD and answers common questions regarding the ethical considerations, clinical assessment, and how UKD kidneys are used to maximize utility. Existing literature on outcomes after UKD is also discussed, along with current controversies. CONCLUSIONS: We believe UKD is an ethically acceptable practice which should continue to grow, despite its controversies. In our experience, these donors are  primarily motivated by a desire to help others and utilization of their kidney as part of a sharing scheme means that many more people seek to benefit from their very generous donation.";;Maple H, Draper H, Gogalniceanu P, Burnapp L, Chilcot J, Mamode N;;eng;['Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Motivation', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/*ethics', 'United Kingdom'];;;HS&DR/13/54/54/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom;10.1097/SLA.0000000000003855

METHODOLOGY: We conducted a scoping review of the recent international literature (2013-2019) to identify moral positions and normative frameworks to justify or criticize pediatric priority in all kind of organ allocation. We identified 11 relevant papers. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a complex juxtaposition of pro and contra argumentations along three main normative lines: a) equal treatment of each individual, b) individual benefit, and c) social benefit and the public good. The general type of argument can be found independent of the organ allocated. For each of these three lines we identified and categorized two types of argumentations: those in favor and those critical of the priority rule. Additionally, we discuss a problematic issue that has not yet  been mentioned in the literature, namely the effects of age thresholds related to child-priority rules in organ allocation. We illustrate this problem with an analysis of selected German data with allocated postmortal kidneys and livers. These data show non-normal distributions of organ transplantations and waiting times for patients between the ages of 16 and 19. DISCUSSION: Our overview serves as a matrix to reconsider existing guideline policy. The review can assist policy makers or experts on organ allocation committees in increasing the transparency of child priority rules, in explaining their justifications, and in reforming existing guidelines.;;Schicktanz S, Simon A, Raphael S, Ahlert M;;eng;;['*Child priority', '*Ethics', '*Organ allocation', '*Policy', '*Scoping review', '*Transplantation'];;;10.1016/j.trre.2020.100543

He argues that psychiatric disorders do not necessarily impair decision-making ability, that they are not necessarily treatable and that legalising PAS for psychiatric patients would not diminish research and therapeutic interest in psychiatric treatments or impair their recovery through loss of hope. However, by erasing distinction between somatic and psychiatric disorders on those grounds, he also erases distinction between healthy adults and patients (whether somatic or psychiatric) essentially implying that PAS should be available to all, for all reasons or, ultimately no reason. Furthermore, as psychiatric patients are much more likely to be a source of usable organs for transplantation, their broad inclusion would strengthen the link between PAS/euthanasia and organ donation, potentially undermining both as well as diminishing already declining general trust in medical authorities and professionals and public health authorities and  activists.;;Buturovic Z;;eng;;['dead donor rule', 'euthanasia', 'public health ethics', 'suicide/assisted suicide', 'transplantation'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2020-106089
1993;32195327;Article;2020;Transplantation direct;;The Moral Status of Organ Donation and Transplantation Within Islamic Law: The Fiqh Council of North America's Position.;;Background: Muslim communities tend to hold more negative attitudes toward organ  donation than other communities. These views, in part, reflect the diverse views  of Islamic scholars who debate the conditions under which donation and transplantation is morally licit. In December 2018, the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) weighed in on the US context of donation and transplantation through an Islamic ethico-legal verdict (fatwa). Methods: Between 2016 and 2018,  FCNA members engaged in multidisciplinary research using conventions of collective Islamic moral deliberation. They examined rulings on organ donation and transplantation issued by Islamic jurists and juridical councils abroad, convened with organ donation and transplantation professionals and stakeholders including families and patients, and consulted medical and bioethics experts. Results: FCNA judges organ donation to be morally permissible from the perspective of Islamic law and ethics, subject to several conditions. These include first-person authorization, that donation occur either while living or after circulatory declaration of death, harm to the donor is minimized, reproductive organs are not donated, among others. Organ transplantation, in general, was also deemed licit. Conclusions: FCNA's verdict uniquely addresses American contexts and has several clinical practice implications. By sharing their perspective with academic and professional stakeholders, the council aims to provide nuanced guidance for assisting Muslims in making informed choices regarding these procedures and further societal dialogue on the ethics and practices of donation and transplantation.;;Padela AI, Auda J;;eng;;;The authors declare no conflicts of interest.;;10.1097/TXD.0000000000000980
1994;32191209;Article;2020;JMIR research protocols;;Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion Versus Static Cold Storage for Expanded Criteria Donors in Liver and Kidney Transplantation: Protocol for a Single-Center Randomized Controlled Trial.;;"BACKGROUND: Extended criteria donors (ECD) are widely utilized due to organ shortage, but they may increase the risk of graft dysfunction and poorer outcomes. Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) is a recent organ preservation  strategy for marginal kidney and liver grafts, allowing a redirect from anaerobic metabolism to aerobic metabolism under hypothermic conditions and protecting grafts from oxidative species-related damage. These mechanisms may improve graft  function and survival. OBJECTIVE: With this study, we will evaluate the benefit of end-ischemic HOPE on ECD grafts for livers and kidneys as compared to static cold storage (SCS). The aim of the study is to demonstrate the ability of HOPE to improve graft function and postoperative outcomes of ECD kidney and liver recipients. METHODS: This is an open-label, single-center randomized clinical trial with the aim of comparing HOPE with SCS in ECD kidney and liver transplantation. In the study protocol, which has been approved by the ethics committee, 220 patients (110 liver recipients and 110 kidney recipients) will be  enrolled. Livers and kidneys assigned to the HOPE group undergo machine perfusion with cold Belzer solution (4-10 degrees C) and continuous oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen of 500-600 mm Hg). In the control group, livers and kidneys undergoing SCS are steeped in Celsior solution and stored on ice. Using the same  perfusion machine for both liver and kidney grafts, organs are perfused from the  start of the back-table procedure until implantation, without increasing the cold ischemia time. For each group, we will evaluate clinical outcomes, graft function tests, histologic findings, perfusate, and the number of allocated organs. Publication of the results is expected to begin in 2021. RESULTS: Dynamic preservation methods for organs from high-risk donors should improve graft dysfunction after transplantation. To date, we have recruited 108 participants. The study is ongoing, and recruitment of participants will continue until January 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed preservation method should improve ECD graft function and consequently the postoperative patient outcomes.

Patients with ACLF-3 who underwent liver transplantation  (LT) between 2007 and 2017 in 5 transplant centers were included (n = 152). Predictors of 1-year mortality were retrospectively screened and tested on a single center training cohort and subsequently tested on an independent multicenter cohort composed of the 4 other centers. Four independent pretransplant risk factors were associated with 1-year mortality after transplantation in the training cohort: age >/=53 years (P = .044), pre-LT arterial lactate level >/=4 mml/L (P = .013), mechanical ventilation with PaO2 /FiO2 </= 200 mm Hg (P = .026), and pre-LT leukocyte count </=10 G/L (P = .004).  A simplified version of the model was derived by assigning 1 point to each risk factor: the transplantation for Aclf-3 model (TAM) score. A cut-off at 2 points distinguished a high-risk group (score >2) from a low-risk group (score </=2) with 1-year survival of 8.3% vs 83.9% respectively (P < .001). This model was subsequently validated in the independent multicenter cohort.

It is uncertain whether the development of UTI has an impact on renal graft function. The objective of this study was to  evaluate the effects of complicated and recurrent UTI on 2-year renal graft function. METHODS: This was a historical cohort study in renal transplantation patients in a kidney transplant center. All renal transplant recipients from June 2004 to September 2016 were included. A linear regression analysis was performed  to study the association between the outcome (variation in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation between month 1 and month 24 post-transplant) and the UTI. The approval of the Ethics and Research Committee to carry out this study was obtained. RESULTS: In total, 276 kidney transplants were performed during the observation period. Of the transplant patients, 193 (69.9%) did not develop a UTI and 83 (30.1%) presented at least 1 complicated UTI. Patients who presented at least 1 UTI had a variation in eGFR during the observation period of -12.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (95% confidence interval [CI] -4.5 to -20.7 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P  = .02), compared with those without a UTI.

Less common has been the use of neonatal organs and tissues for research. Specific ethical and legal questions beg for rational and transparent guidelines with which to evaluate referrals of potential donors. Donation of organs and tissues from a neonate can  play a key role in the care and support provided to families by health care professionals around the time of a neonate's death. We report on the recovery of  neonatal organs and tissues for research. A working group made up of bioethicists, neonatologists, lawyers, obstetric practioners as well as organ procurement and tissue banking professionals evaluated legal, ethical and medical issues. Neonatal donor family members were also consulted. Our primary goals were (a) to ensure that referrals were made in compliance with all applicable federal  and state laws, regulations and institutional protocols, and (b) to follow acceptable ethical standards. Algorithms and policies designed to assist in the evaluation of potential neonatal donors were developed. Neonatal donation is proving increasingly valuable for research into areas including diabetes, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and neurological development, rheumatoid arthritis, autism, childhood psychiatric and neurologic disorders, treatment of MRSA infection and pediatric emergency resuscitation.

Only a few legal and regulatory frameworks incentivise LOD, with the key exception of Israel's Organ Transplant Law, which has produced  significant improvements in organ donation rates. Therefore, I propose an organ procurement system that incentivises LOD by allocating additional priority points to the living donor on any transplant waiting list.

2006;32054776;Article;2020;Journal of medical ethics;;Design thinking in medical ethics education.;;BACKGROUND: Design thinking (DT) is a tool for generating and exploring ideas from multiple stakeholders. We used DT principles to introduce students to the ethical implications of organ transplantation. Students applied DT principles to  propose solutions to maximise social justice in liver transplant allocation. METHODS: A 150 min interactive workshop was integrated into the longitudinal ethics curriculum. Following a group didactic on challenges of organ donation in  the USA supplemented by patient stories, teams of students considered alternative solutions to optimise fairness of organ distribution and ethical implications of  changing the current model. Facilitators led students through DT steps of empathy, defining the team's point of view, ideating on potential solutions, prototyping a specific idea and testing the idea through oral presentation, with  questions and answers by peers and faculty. The curriculum was evaluated with presurveys and postsurveys including quantitative and open-ended items. RESULTS:  100 first year medical students participated. Before the session, 75.3% of students had no practical experience with DT. Following participation, students reported an increased understanding of the current liver transplant allocation system (p<0.01) and an increased appreciation of shortcomings of the current organ allocation system (p<0.01). After the session, 73.8% of students felt that  DT could be used to approach complex health system problems. DISCUSSION: Students participating in a DT workshop displayed improved knowledge and attitudes toward  organ transplantation and DT. In this pilot study, DT showed promise as a student-led approach emphasising collaboration and creativity in ethics curricula in medical education.;;Marcus D, Simone A, Block L;;eng;;['*education for health care professionals', '*education/programmes', '*transplantation'];Competing interests: None declared.;;10.1136/medethics-2019-105989

In this systematic review, we aim to describe current practices of soliciting consent for participation in prospective studies of neurologically deceased donors, including the frequency and justification for these various models of consent. Among the 74 studies included, 14 did not report on any regulatory review, and 13 did not report on the study consent procedures. Of the remaining 47 studies, 24 utilized  a waiver of research consent. The most common justification for a waiver of research consent related to the fact that neurologically deceased donors are not  considered human subjects. In conclusion, among studies of neurologically deceased donors, research consent models vary and are inconsistently reported. Consensus and standardization in the application of research consent models will  help to advance this emerging field of research.;;D'Aragon F, Burns KEA, Yaworski A, Lucas A, Arseneau E, Belley-Cote E, Dhanani S, Frenette AJ, Lamontagne F, Lauzier F, Akhtar A, Oczkowski S, Rochwerg B, Meade MO;;eng;;['*donor intervention', '*organ donation', '*research consent', '*transplantation'];;;10.1177/1556264620904627

However, r/r B-NHL remissions are durable in fewer than half of recipients of second-generation CAR  T-cells. Third-generation (3G) CARs employ two costimulatory domains, resulting in improved CAR T-cell efficacy in vitro and in animal models in vivo. This investigator-initiated, phase I dose escalation trial, termed ENABLE, will investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of WZTL-002, comprising autologous T-cells expressing a 3G anti-CD19 CAR incorporating the intracellular  signalling domains of CD28 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) for the treatment of r/r B-NHL. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eligible participants will be adults with r/r B-NHL including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and its variants, follicular lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Participants  must have satisfactory organ function, and lack other curative options. Autologous T-cells will be obtained by leukapheresis. Following WZTL-002 manufacture and product release, participants will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising intravenous fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. A single dose of WZTL-002 will be administered intravenously 2 days later. Targeted assessments for cytokine release syndrome and immune cell effector-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, graded by the American Society Transplantation and Cellular Therapy criteria, will be made. A modified 3+3 dose escalation scheme is planned starting at 5x10(4) CAR T-cells/kg with a maximum dose of 1x10(6) CAR T-cells/kg. The primary outcome of this trial is safety of WZTL-002. Secondary outcomes include feasibility of WZTL-002 manufacture and preliminary measures of  efficacy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was granted by the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (reference 19/STH/69) on 23 June 2019 for Protocol V.1.2. Trial results will be reported in a peer-reviewed journal, and results presented at scientific conferences or meetings.

It is one of the most severe chronic non-communicable diseases. Haemodialysis (HD) is the most common therapeutic option but is also associated with a risk of cardiovascular events, hospitalisation and suboptimal quality of life. Over the past decades, haemodiafiltration (HDF) has become available. Although high-dose HDF has shown some promising survival advantage compared to conventional HD, the evidence remains controversial. A Cochrane systematic review found, in low-quality trials, with various convective forms of dialysis, a reduction in cardiovascular, but not all-cause mortality and the effects on non-fatal cardiovascular events and hospitalisation were uncertain. In contrast, an individual patient data analysis  suggested that high-dose HDF reduced both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality  compared to HD. In view of these discrepant results, a definitive trial is required to determine whether high-dose HDF is preferable to high-flux HD. The comparison of high-dose HDF with high-flux HD (CONVINCE) study will assess the benefits and harms of high-dose HDF versus a conventional high-flux HD in adults  with ESKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This international, prospective, open label, randomised controlled trial aims to recruit 1800 ESKD adults treated with HD in nine European countries. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to high-dose HDF versus  continuation of conventional high-flux HD. The primary outcome will be all-cause  mortality at 3 years' follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include cause-specific mortality, cardiovascular events, all-cause and infection-related hospitalisations, patient-reported outcomes (eg, health-related quality of life)  and cost-effectiveness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The CONVINCE study will address the question of benefits and harms of high-dose HDF compared to high-flux HD for  kidney replacement therapy in patients with ESKD with a focus on survival, patient perspectives and cost-effectiveness.

During the past  2 decades, various groups have provided guidance about the evaluation and care of living donors. However, during this time, our knowledge in the field has advanced substantially and many agreed on the need for a comprehensive, unifying document. KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) addressed this issue at an international level with the publication of its clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors. The KDIGO work group extensively reviewed the available literature and wrote a series of guideline recommendations using various degrees of evidence when available. As has become recent practice,  NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) convened a work group to provide a commentary on the KDIGO guideline, with a focus on how these recommendations apply in the context of the United States. In  the United States, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) guides and regulates the practice of living kidney donation. While the KDIGO guideline for the care of living kidney donors and UNOS policy are similar in most aspects of the care of living kidney donors, several important areas are not consistent or do not align with common practice by US transplantation programs in areas in which UNOS has not set specific policy. For the time being, and recognizing the value of the KDIGO guidelines, US transplantation programs should continue to follow UNOS policy.;;Mandelbrot DA, Reese PP, Garg N, Thomas CP, Rodrigue JR, Schinstock C, Doshi M, Cooper M, Friedewald J, Naik AS, Kaul DR, Ison MG, Rocco MV, Verbesey J, Hladunewich MA, Ibrahim HN, Poggio ED;;eng;['Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*standards', '*Living Donors', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*surgery', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*standards'];['*Living kidney donation', '*albuminuria', '*best practices', '*clinical practice guideline', '*contraindication', '*diabetes', '*donor candidate', '*donor counseling', '*donor evaluation', '*donor follow-up', '*donor safety', '*donor selection', '*end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', '*ethics', '*genetic risk', '*glomerular filtration rate (GFR)', '*hypertension', '*informed consent', '*kidney donor', '*kidney failure', '*kidney function', '*long-term risk', '*nephrectomy', '*postdonation monitoring', '*pregnancy', '*psychosocial evaluation'];;R01 DK114877/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States;10.1053/j.ajkd.2019.10.005
2014;32002917;Article;2020;Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.);;Regulation of Clinical Xenotransplantation: A Reappraisal of the Legal, Ethical,  and Social Aspects Involved.;;Clinical trials of encapsulated pig islet transplantation are underway and are showing promising results. In addition, better immunosuppressant drug regimens and a wealth of new gene-edited pig varieties are raising new hopes in this field. Thus, consideration is also being given to the selection of patients for initial clinical trials of pig solid organ xenotransplantation. It seems likely that clinical trials of pig organ will be initiated within the next couple of years. For the moment, transplanting porcine islets to treat type 1 diabetes is generally viewed as the most likely to reach the clinical first. Further advances will hopefully make this approach a treatment choice for patients with this condition. Regulatory framework for this type of xenotransplantation is now available in several countries, and there is also a wider awareness of the importance of developing an internationally harmonized regulatory framework. For  now, xenotransplantation is mainly conceived and regulated as a pharmaceutical product. The reframing of this emerging technology as cell therapy has redefined  the normative landscape. Countries should be cautious about allowing xenotransplantation clinical trials to develop. But the original meaning of precaution, referred to safety measures in order to control risks of infection, is no longer seen as requiring restrictive limitations on fundamental rights. As  with any new medicinal product, safety is certainly a crucial topic in research.  Specific to xenotransplantation is the safety of porcine product. In this regard, regulatory frameworks should contain specific conditions about the safety of the  source animals, of the xenotransplantation product, and of the manufacturing process. In turn, these frameworks should ensure that preclinical studies indicate safety and efficacy of the procedure and that risk management protocols  are in place to identify, contain, and combat any outbreak of infection in a timely manner. The fragile balance between individual and collective rights and the tensions of globalization make necessary a coordinated international action to harmonize global practices in this field. Xenotransplantation clinical trials  should be carried out in a context in which specific safety and ethical issues are addressed and in an environment in which specific practices that facilitate public engagement as a form of shared responsibility for regulatory decision-making are promoted as well.;;Jorqui-Azofra M;;eng;['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Decision Making', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/ethics', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation', 'Legislation, Medical', 'Models, Animal', 'Risk Assessment', 'Social Stigma', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence'];['*Advanced therapy medicinal products', '*Globalization', '*Individual rights', '*Infectious disease', '*Informed consent', '*Public health', '*Public participation', '*Risk-benefit evaluation', '*Xenotransplantation clinical trials'];;;10.1007/978-1-0716-0255-3_20

The decision to accept a kidney from a deceased donor can be a difficult one, especially when organs from high KDPI (>85%) donors are offered. This study aims to capture the perspectives of transplant nephrologists  (TNs) on the decision-making process when an organ is offered. METHODS: Fifteen Canadian TNs took part in semi-structured interviews between December 2017 and April 2018. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the thematic analysis method. RESULTS: The decision to accept a deceased-donor kidney offer is a medical one for the participants. However, transplant candidates could be involved when the offered kidney is from a donor with a KDPI >85% or increased infectious risk donor. The TNs' past experience, comprehensive data on the donor, and education of the transplant candidate could  facilitate the decision-making process. A decision aid could also facilitate the  decision-making process, but different concerns should be addressed. CONCLUSION:  Although accepting a deceased-donor organ offer is often viewed as an opportunity for shared decision-making, participants in this study viewed the decision to accept or refuse an offer as a medical decision with little room for patient participation.;;Cardinal H, Ballesteros Gallego F, Affdal A, Fortin MC;;eng;;['*clinical decision-making', '*donors and donation: deceased', '*ethics'];;;10.1111/ctr.13793

CONCLUSIONS: Around the world, the number of required corneal transplants exceeds the number of donated corneas that are available and suitable for transplantation. This shortage of corneal tissue has led to the emergence of practices that may put the 4 basic principles of bioethics at risk: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Therefore, it has been necessary to create ethical guidelines such as the Barcelona Principles and the World Health Organization Principles of Transplantation that attempt to regulate these practices.;;Cordoba A, Mejia LF, Mannis MJ, Navas A, Madrigal-Bustamante JA, Graue-Hernandez EO;;eng;['*Bioethics', 'Corneal Transplantation/*ethics', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*ethics', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/ICO.0000000000002246

Death in donation after circulatory death (DCD) can be defined by the permanent cessation  of brain circulation. Post-mortem interventions that restore brain perfusion should be prohibited as they invalidate the diagnosis of death. Retrieval teams should develop protocols that ensure the continued absence of brain perfusion during DCD organ recovery. In situ normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) or restarting the heart in the donor's body may interrupt the permanent cessation of brain perfusion because, theoretically, collateral circulations may restore it. We propose refinements to current protocols to monitor and exclude brain reperfusion during in situ NRP. In abdominal NRP, complete occlusion of the descending aorta prevents brain perfusion in most cases. Inserting a cannula in the ascending aorta identifies inadequate occlusion of the descending aorta or any collateral flow and diverts flow away from the brain. In thoracoabdominal NRP opening the aortic arch vessels to atmosphere allows collateral flow to be diverted away from the brain, maintaining the permanence standard for death and respecting the dead donor rule. We propose that these hypotheses are correct when using techniques that simultaneously occlude the descending aorta and open the aortic arch vessels to atmosphere.;;Manara A, Shemie SD, Large S, Healey A, Baker A, Badiwala M, Berman M, Butler AJ, Chaudhury P, Dark J, Forsythe J, Freed DH, Gardiner D, Harvey D, Hornby L, MacLean J, Messer S, Oniscu GC, Simpson C, Teitelbaum J, Torrance S, Wilson LC, Watson CJE;;eng;;['*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics', '*extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)', '*organ perfusion and preservation', '*organ procurement', '*organ procurement and allocation'];;;10.1111/ajt.15775

The most effective and resource-efficient method for mitigating warm ischemia after circulatory arrest is normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) in situ. This strategy requires restarting circulation after declaration of death according to circulatory criteria, which appears to challenge the legal circulatory death definition requiring irreversible cessation. Permanent cessation for life-saving efforts must be achieved to assuage this concern and ligating principal vessels maintains no blood flow to the brain, which ensures natural progression to cessation of brain function. This practice-standard in some countries-raises unique concerns about prioritizing life-saving efforts, informed authorization from decision-makers, and the clinician's role in the patient's death. To preserve public trust, medical integrity, and respect for the donor, the donation conversation must not take place until after an un-coerced decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment made in accordance with the patient's treatment goals. The decision-maker(s) must understand cDCD procedure well enough to provide genuine authorization and the preservation/procurement teams must be kept separate from the clinical care team.;;Parent B, Moazami N, Wall S, Carillo J, Kon Z, Smith D, Walsh BC, Caplan A;;eng;;['*donors and donation: donation after circulatory death (DCD)', '*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)', '*heart transplantation/cardiology', '*organ procurement and allocation', '*organ transplantation in general'];;;10.1111/ajt.15772

Transplant pulmonologists' views of SPC may be key to understanding SPC utilization but have not been well characterized. Objectives: (1) To understand how transplant pulmonologists view SPC and decide to refer transplant recipients and (2) to identify unique aspects of lung transplantation that may influence referral decisions. Design: We conducted semistructured interviews with transplant pulmonologists at nine geographically diverse high-volume North American transplant centers with SPC services. A multidisciplinary team analyzed interview transcripts using constant comparative methods to inductively develop and refine  a coding framework related to SPC views and referral decisions. Results: We interviewed 38 transplant pulmonologists; most (36/38) had referred lung transplant recipients to SPC. Participants described SPC as a medical specialty that aims to improve quality of life and distinguished SPC from hospice care, which was considered end-of-life care. Participants who viewed transplant as a temporary solution (n = 17/38, 45%) described earlier utilization of SPC alongside disease-directed therapies, whereas those who viewed transplant as survival-focused (n = 21/38, 55%) described utilization of SPC after disease-directed therapies were exhausted. Concerns about one-year survival metrics and use of addicting medications for symptom palliation were barriers to  referral. Conclusions: Transplant pulmonologists' SPC referral practices may be related to their views of lung transplantation. Optimizing use of SPC in lung transplantation will require improving communication between transplant pulmonology and SPC to ensure a collaborative effort toward patient-centered goals while addressing unique barriers to SPC referral.";;Nolley E, Fleck J, Kavalieratos D, Dew MA, Dilling D, Colman R, Crespo MM, Goldberg H, Hays S, Hachem R, Lease E, Lee J, Reynolds J, Morrell M, Schenker Y;;eng;;['*lung transplantation', '*palliative care', '*solid organ transplantation'];;K01 HL133466/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;10.1089/jpm.2019.0222

Compared with evidence-based criteria used to determine transplant eligibility, the ID criterion remains controversial because of its potential to be discriminatory, subjective, and because its relationship to outcomes is uncertain. Use of ID in determining transplant candidacy may stem partly from perceived worse adherence and outcomes for patients with ID, fear of  penalties to transplant centers for poor outcomes, and stigma surrounding the quality of life for people with ID. However, using ID as a contraindication to solid organ transplantation is not evidence-based and reduces equitable access to transplantation, disadvantaging an already vulnerable population. Variability and lack of transparency in referral and evaluation allows for gatekeeping, threatens patient autonomy, limits access to lifesaving treatment, and may be seen as unfair. We examine the benefits and harms of using ID as a transplant eligibility criterion, review current clinical evidence and ethical considerations, and make  recommendations for transplant teams and regulatory agencies to ensure fair access to transplant for individuals with ID.;;Chen A, Ahmad M, Flescher A, Freeman WL, Little S, Martins PN, Veatch RM, Wightman A, Ladin K;;eng;;['*disparities', '*editorial/personal viewpoint', '*ethics', '*ethics and public policy', '*guidelines', '*law/legislation', '*organ transplantation in general', '*patient characteristics', '*pediatrics', '*recipient selection'];;;10.1111/ajt.15755

2027;31834006;Article;2020;Current opinion in organ transplantation;;Should living donor liver transplant selection be subject to the same restrictions as deceased donor transplant?;;PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the United States, most of the liver allografts come from deceased donors, and our current liver recipient selection process is heavily centered on the ethical principle of utility to maximize the net benefit to the liver recipient community as a group rather than individuals due to the organ scarcity. Although living donor liver transplantation contributes less than 5% of total liver transplant in the United States, these living donor recipients are being subjected to the same selection process designed to benefit the group as a  whole rather than the individuals. We would like to examine if these recipients who have living donors should be subjected to the same selection process. RECENT  FINDINGS: There are several disease processes where liver transplantation is the  only curative option, and recent studies have shown clear survival benefits with  liver transplantation. SUMMARY: For those who have living donors, different selection criteria based on their specific disease, not based on the principle of utilization should be used to evaluate their candidacy.;;Kwon YK, Etesami K, Genyk Y;;eng;['Donor Selection/*methods', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases', 'Liver Transplantation/*methods', 'Living Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Patient Selection/*ethics'];;;;10.1097/MOT.0000000000000728

Therefore, this study aimed to present the case of a pregnant patient developing  brain death which occurred in our intensive care unit and to compare the medical, ethical and legal problems relating to pregnant cases developing brain death with 24 cases in the literature. A 21-year-old 19-week pregnant case with gestational  diabetes was monitored in the anesthesia intensive care unit and developed brain  death due to intracranial mass and intraventricular hemorrhage. Though brain death is a situation well understood by organ transplant professionals, brain death developing in pregnant patients still involves many medical, ethical and legal problems.;;Boran OF, Yazar FM, Bakacak M, Soylu D, Yazar N, Oksuz H;;eng;['Asia', 'Brain Death/*diagnostic imaging', 'Brain Neoplasms/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Cerebral Intraventricular Hemorrhage/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Ethics', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Islam', '*Organ Transplantation/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics/*legislation & jurisprudence', '*Tissue and Organ Procurement', 'Ultrasonography', 'Young Adult'];['Brain death in pregnancy', 'Donation decision', 'Muslim families'];;;10.1007/s10943-019-00952-1

2031;31638090;Article;2020;Neural regeneration research;;Inhibiting endogenous tissue plasminogen activator enhanced neuronal apoptosis and axonal injury after traumatic brain injury.;;Tissue plasminogen activator is usually used for the treatment of acute ischemic  stroke, but the role of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator in traumatic brain injury has been rarely reported. A rat model of traumatic brain injury was  established by weight-drop method. The tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor neuroserpin (5 muL, 0.25 mg/mL) was injected into the lateral ventricle. Neurological function was assessed by neurological severity score. Neuronal and axonal injuries were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Bielschowsky silver staining. Protein level of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator was analyzed by western blot assay. Apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3, neuronal marker neurofilament light chain, astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein and microglial marker Iba-1 were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Apoptotic cell types were detected by immunofluorescence double labeling. Apoptotic cells in the damaged cortex were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling staining. Degenerating neurons in the damaged cortex were detected by Fluoro-Jade B staining. Expression of tissue plasminogen activator was increased at 6 hours,  and peaked at 3 days after traumatic brain injury. Neuronal apoptosis and axonal  injury were detected after traumatic brain injury. Moreover, neuroserpin enhanced neuronal apoptosis, neuronal injury and axonal injury, and activated microglia and astrocytes. Neuroserpin further deteriorated neurobehavioral function in rats with traumatic brain injury. Our findings confirm that inhibition of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator aggravates neuronal apoptosis and axonal injury after traumatic brain injury, and activates microglia and astrocytes. This study  was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Committee of Animal Experiments of Shaanxi  Province of China in June 2015.;;Zhao JJ, Liu ZW, Wang B, Huang TQ, Guo D, Zhao YL, Song JN;;eng;;['apoptosis', 'astrocytes', 'axonal injury', 'inflammation', 'microglia', 'nerve regeneration', 'neural regeneration', 'neuronal injury', 'neurons', 'neuroserpin', 'tissue plasminogen activator', 'traumatic brain injury'];None;;10.4103/1673-5374.266914
2032;31568213;Article;2020;Transplantation;;Urine Injury Biomarkers Are Not Associated With Kidney Transplant Failure.;;BACKGROUND: Kidneys transplanted from deceased donors with serum creatinine-defined acute kidney injury (AKI) have similar allograft survival as non-AKI kidneys but are discarded at a higher rate. Urine injury biomarkers are sensitive markers of structural kidney damage and may more accurately predict graft outcomes. METHODS: In the 2010-2013 multicenter Deceased Donor Study of 2430 kidney transplant recipients from 1298 donors, we assessed the association of donor urine injury biomarkers microalbumin, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule-1, IL-18, and liver-type fatty acid binding protein with graft failure (GF) and death-censored GF (dcGF) using Cox proportional hazard models (median follow-up 4 y). We examined if serum creatinine-defined donor AKI modified this association to assess the relationship between subclinical donor AKI (elevated biomarkers without creatinine-defined AKI) and GF. Through chart review of a subcohort (1137 recipients), we determined associations between donor injury biomarkers and a 3-year composite outcome of GF, mortality, or estimated glomerular filtration rate </= 20mL/min/1.73m. RESULTS: Risk of GF, dcGF, and 3-year composite outcome did not vary with donor injury biomarker concentrations after adjusting for donor, transplant, and recipient characteristics (adjusted hazard ratio ranged from 0.96 to 1.01 per log-2 increase in biomarker). Subclinical injury in transplanted kidneys without  AKI was not associated with GF. CONCLUSIONS: AKI measured using injury biomarkers was not associated with posttransplant graft outcomes (at median 4 y posttransplant). When assessing posttransplant graft viability, clinicians can prioritize other donor and recipient factors over donor kidney injury, measured by either serum creatinine or urine injury biomarkers.;;Koyawala N, Reese PP, Hall IE, Jia Y, Thiessen-Philbrook HR, Mansour SG, Doshi MD, Akalin E, Bromberg JS, Harhay MN, Mohan S, Muthukumar T, Schroppel B, Singh P, Weng FL, Parikh CR;;eng;['Acute Kidney Injury/*diagnosis/physiopathology/urine', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts/physiopathology', 'Biomarkers/urine', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/physiology', 'Graft Rejection/*epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/physiopathology', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/mortality/*surgery', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome'];;;UL1 TR002538/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States;10.1097/TP.0000000000002948
2033;31317465;Article;2020;Journal of religion and health;;Global Scientific Outputs of Brain Death Publications and Evaluation According to the Religions of Countries.;;"In 1950s, the concept of brain death, which began to be discussed primarily in terms of medicine and then in terms of religion, law, and ethics, became a central topic in all world countries as it was an early diagnosis of death. Despite the fact that brain death (BD) diagnosis is of importance for benefitting from organ and tissue transplantation of patients in the world, the literature still involves no bibliometric studies that made a holistic evaluation of the publications about this issue. The present study aims to investigate the top-cited articles about BD published between 1980 and 2018, identify the citation collaboration of the journals, demonstrate the collaboration between the countries, define the relationship between organ transplantation and BD, and reveal the latest developments and trend topics about this issue. In addition, this study aims to investigate the relationship between religions of countries and brain death publication productivity. Documents for bibliometric analysis were downloaded from Web of Science. The literature search was performed using the keywords ""brain death/dead"" during 1980-2018. The correlations between gross  domestic product (GDP), Human Development Index (HDI) and publication productivity of the countries on BD were investigated with Spearman's correlation coefficient. There was a high-level, statistically significant correlation between the number of publications and GDP, and HDI and the number of publications about BD (r = 0.761, p < 0.001; r = 0.703, p < 0.001). The USA was the top country in terms of publication productivity, which was followed by developed countries such as Germany, Japan, France, and Spain. However, the contribution of the undeveloped or developing countries such as China, Brazil, Turkey, Iran, and South Africa was found to be considerably important. While many people in the world die with undamaged organs, many other people die needing those organs. Therefore, it is considered that the collaborations and thus multidisciplinary studies about BD should be increased in the world countries, and the countries should be involved in bigger collaborations instead of little clusters. Especially, Muslim countries should be encouraged to do research and publish studies about the issues of brain death and organ transplantation.";;Dogan G, Kayir S;;eng;['*Biomedical Research', '*Brain Death', 'Child', 'Global Health', 'Humans', '*Periodicals as Topic', 'Publishing'];['Bibliometrics', 'Brain dead', 'Brain death', 'Organ donor', 'Religion', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1007/s10943-019-00886-8
2034;31087205;Article;2020;Medicine, health care, and philosophy;;The ethical obligation of the dead donor rule.;;The dead donor rule (DDR) originally stated that organ donors must not be killed  by and for organ donation. Scholars later added the requirement that vital organs should not be procured before death. Some now argue that the DDR is breached in donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD) programs. DCDD programs  do not breach the original version of the DDR because vital organs are procured only after circulation has ceased permanently as a consequence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. We hold that the original rendition of the DDR banning killing by and for organ donation is the fundamental norm that should be maintained in transplantation ethics. We propose separating the DDR from two other fundamental normative rules: the duties to prevent harm and to obtain informed consent.;;Dalle Ave AL, Sulmasy DP, Bernat JL;;eng;['Brain Death', '*Death', 'Humans', 'Life Support Systems/*ethics', '*Moral Obligations', 'Tissue Donors/*ethics'];['Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD)', 'Ethics', 'The dead donor rule (DDR)', 'Transplantation'];;;10.1007/s11019-019-09904-8
