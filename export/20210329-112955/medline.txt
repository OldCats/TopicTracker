TI  - [Chronic treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by beta blocking agents. Clinical
      and hemodynamic follow-up].
PG  - 835-42
AB  - symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied in order to evaluate the effect
      of long term sympathetic beta-blockade with metoprolol. Clinical evaluation,
      stress test, two-dimensional echocardiography, 24 hour ambulatory
      electrocardiography and hemodynamic assessment with Swan-Ganz catheter were
      performed before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to the 
      relative placebo (8 pts) or metoprolol group (12 pts) in a single-blind fashion. 
      The placebo group received standard therapy (digitalis, diuretics, vasodilators
      and anticoagulants as needed), while the metoprolol group, along with standard
      therapy received low-dose beta-blockade, starting with 6.25 mg twice daily and
      then doubling every 4 days on the two daily administrations. The therapeutic
      end-point was 100 mg. Patients received less than 100 mg if their systolic blood 
      pressure was less than 100 mmHg or if their resting heart rate was less than 55
      beats/min. Patients were clinically assessed every month and a 24-hour
      electrocardiography, echocardiography and hemodynamic control was repeated after 
      six months. In the metoprolol group there was one sudden death and two
      drop-outs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Validity and reproducibility of alcohol consumption in Italy.
PG  - 775-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: The reproducibility and validity of alcohol consumption has not been 
      adequately studied, particularly in mediterranean countries, where alcohol
      drinking is a widespread habit, especially during meals. METHODS: We compared
      alcohol consumption measured by two interviewer-administered food frequency
      questionnaires (FFQ) with average intake derived from two 7-day dietary (7-DD)
      records (the reference method) on 395 volunteers. Different types of alcoholic
      beverages were considered separately in order to verify the ability of the
      questionnaire to assess detailed patterns of alcohol intake. RESULTS: A
      satisfactory level of reproducibility and validity of the pattern of alcohol
      consumption across different levels and types of alcoholic beverage intake was
      observed. The reproducibility of wine and total alcohol intake showed correlation
      coefficients > 0.75 in both sexes. The validity was somewhat higher for wine
      (around 0.70) than for other alcoholic beverages and total alcohol intake. This
      is probably accounted for by the more regular pattern of wine consumption during 
      the year as compared to other alcoholic beverages (beer, grappa, etc) which are
      more strongly influenced by seasonal and daily variations. However, about 30% of 
      abstainers according to FFQ were drinkers by the reference method. The opposite
      was observed in only 4% of subjects. CONCLUSION: The FFQ is a reliable and valid 
      instrument for collecting alcohol intake in regular drinkers. Lower validity in
      irregular drinkers may be due to seasonal variation and/or inadequacy of the FFQ 
      to capture irregular patterns of consumption and/or inadequacy of the average of 
      two 7-DD as a reference method. Furthermore, a considerable degree of
      misclassification was observed between non-drinkers and moderate drinkers.

TI  - Alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer: a multicentre Italian case-control
      study.
PG  - 1403-9
AB  - The relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk was
      investigated using data from a co-operative case-control study conducted in Italy
      between 1991 and 1994 on 2569 incident, histologically confirmed breast cancer
      cases and 2588 controls in hospital for acute, non-neoplastic, non-hormone
      related conditions. Overall, 915 (38%) cases and 1048 (43%) controls were
      abstainers. Compared with them, the odds ratio (OR), adjusted only for age, was
      1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.53) for drinkers and became 1.39 (95%
      CI 1.(1)21-1.60) after correction for measurement error. The multivariate OR was 
      1.21 for drinkers of < or = 5.87 g/day and 1.23, 1.19, 1.21, 1.41 for drinkers of
      5.88-13.40, 13.41-24.55, 24.56-27.60, > 27.60 g/day, respectively. The trend in
      risk was significant (chi 2 = 12.28, P < 0.0005). The association was apparently 
      stronger in premenopausal women (OR = 1.80 for > 27.60 g/day). Considering the
      different types of alcoholic beverages (wine, beer, digestives, grappa and other 
      spirits), a significant direct trend in breast cancer risk was seen for wine with
      an OR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.06-1.53) for the category > 26.34 g/day. The ORs were
      also above unity for beer, grappa, digestives and spirits drinkers. No
      appreciable interaction was observed between alcohol drinking and body mass
      index, smoking, or any other covariate considered. Thus, the present data, based 
      on a validated alcohol consumption questionnaire and on a population
      characterised by a relatively high alcohol consumption in women, confirmed that
      alcohol drinking is moderately related to breast cancer risk. If causal, this
      association could explain 12% (95% CI, 5-19%) of breast cancers in Italy, thus
      representing one of the major avoidable risk factor for breast cancer.

TI  - Alcohol, smoking, coffee and risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction in
      Italy.
PG  - 1131-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the relation between cigarette smoking, alcohol, coffee,
      decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption, and the risk of non-fatal acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN AND SETTING: Hospital-based case-control
      study conducted in 1995-1999 in Milan, Italy. PATIENTS: 507 cases with a first
      episode of non-fatal AMI, and 478 controls admitted to hospital for acute
      diseases. METHODS: Information was collected by interviewer-administered
      questionnaires. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
      calculated by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared to alcohol
      non-drinkers the OR was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-0.9) in drinkers, and 0.5 in drinkers of
      > 3 drinks/day. The OR for > 1 drink/day of wine was 0.5, and those for beer,
      amari, grappa and spirits ranged between 0.4 and 0.6. Compared to never smokers, 
      the OR was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5-3.1) among current smokers, and 4.6 among current
      smokers of > or = 25 cigarettes/day. The risk was similar to that of never
      smokers > or = 5 years after cessation (OR: 1.1 after 5-9 years, 0.7 after > or =
      10 years). The OR was 2.3 for low tar cigarettes and 2.0 for high tar ones. The
      OR for coffee intake (expresso and mocha) was around unity up to 3 cups/ day, but
      rose to 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.3) for > or = 6 cups/ day. Moderate decaffeinated
      coffee and tea intake was not associated with AMI risk. Compared to non-smokers
      drinking < or = 3 cups of coffee/day, the OR was 1.6 among non-smokers drinking >
      3 cups of coffee/ day and 3.3 (95% CI: 2.1-5.0) among current smokers drinking < 
      or = 3 cups of coffee/day. Compared to alcohol drinkers with a coffee intake of <
      or = 3 cups/ day, alcohol non-drinkers with higher coffee intake had an OR of
      2.2, and compared to non-smokers alcohol drinkers, the OR was 3.3 in current
      smokers alcohol non-drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: In this Italian population alcohol
      intake was inversely associated to AMI risk, while smoking and heavy (but not
      moderate) coffee drinking increased the risk.

TI  - Coffee and alcohol intake and risk of ovarian cancer: an Italian case-control
      study.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - The relation between coffee and alcohol intake and ovarian cancer risk was
      analyzed in a case-control study conducted in Italy between 1992 and 1999. Cases 
      were 1,031 women, aged 18-79 years, with incident, histologically confirmed
      invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, and controls were 2,411 women, aged 17-79
      years, admitted to the hospital for acute nonneoplastic non-hormone-related
      diseases. Coffee intake (mostly espresso and mocha) was not associated with
      ovarian cancer risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.93 [95% confidence interval
      (CI) = 0.69-1.27] in drinkers of > or = 4 cups/day compared with drinkers of < 1 
      cup/day. No meaningful relation was observed with cappuccino (OR = 1.06, 95% CI =
      0.85-1.32 for drinkers compared with nondrinkers), decaffeinated coffee (OR =
      0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96), and tea intake (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.75-1.08). Total
      alcohol intake was not associated with ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.09, 95% CI =
      0.76-1.57 in drinkers of > or = 36 g/day compared with never drinkers). No
      relationship was found with wine (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.70-1.50 for > 39 g/day
      compared with never drinkers), beer, amari, grappa, and spirits. No significant
      heterogeneity was found for coffee or total alcohol intake across strata of age, 
      education, parity, oral contraceptive use, family history of ovarian/breast
      cancer, body mass index, and calorie intake. This study, based on a large data
      set; provides no support for a causal association between invasive epithelial
      ovarian cancer risk and coffee and alcohol intake.

TI  - Fast magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at 3 Tesla using autocalibrating
      parallel technique.
PG  - 1866-9
AB  - Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a powerful tool for diagnosis 
      of many pathologic conditions. However conventional MRSI involves long scan
      times, in the order of 20 minutes. This work simulated an autocalibrating
      parallel technique based on GRAPPA algorithm for accelerating MRSI and applied it
      to 3 dimensional (3D) MRSI of the brain at 3 Tesla. Employing two fold
      undersampling in two phase-encoding directions, a four fold reduction in scantime
      was simulated. Metabolic parameters showed close agreement between the full and
      GRAPPA reconstructed spectral data.

TI  - Partially parallel MR spectroscopic imaging of gliomas at 3T.
PG  - 493-6
AB  - Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has been used to more accurately 
      diagnose, localize, and assess progression and treatment response for gliomas.
      The main limitation of the MRSI is the long data acquisition times. A current
      approach is to reduce the amount of k-space data sampled by limiting the data
      acquisition to a central elliptical portion of k-space. This study investigated
      the feasibility of reducing the data acquisition time further for the MRSI data
      using two parallel imaging techniques and investigating the relative performance 
      of sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and generalized autocalibrating partially
      parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA).

TI  - Parallel imaging for first-pass myocardial perfusion.
PG  - 678-83
AB  - Two parallel imaging methods used for first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging
      were compared in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio
      (CNR) and image artifacts. One used adaptive Time-adaptive SENSitivity Encoding
      (TSENSE) and the other used GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel
      Acquisition (GRAPPA), which are both applied to a gradient-echo sequence. Both
      methods were tested on 12 patients with coronary artery disease. The order of
      perfusion sequences was inverted in every other patient. Image acquisition was
      started during the administration of a contrast bolus followed by a 20-ml saline 
      flush (3 ml/s), and the next perfusion was started at least 15 min thereafter
      using an identical bolus. An acceleration rate of 2 was used in both methods, and
      acquisition was performed during breath-holding. Significantly higher SNR, CNR
      and image quality were obtained with GRAPPA images than with TSENSE images.
      GRAPPA, however, did not yield a higher CNR when applied after the second bolus. 
      GRAPPA perfusion imaging produced larger differences between subjects than did
      TSENSE. Compared to TSENSE, GRAPPA produced significantly better CNR on the first
      bolus. More consistent SNR and CNR were obtained from TSENSE images than from
      GRAPPA images, indicating that the diagnostic value of TSENSE may be better.

TI  - Fast 3D coronary artery contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography with
      magnetization transfer contrast, fat suppression and parallel imaging as applied 
      on an anthropomorphic moving heart phantom.
PG  - 895-902
AB  - A magnetic resonance sequence for high-resolution imaging of coronary arteries in
      a very short acquisition time is presented. The technique is based on fast
      low-angle shot and uses fat saturation and magnetization transfer contrast
      prepulses to improve image contrast. GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially
      Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) is implemented to shorten acquisition time. The
      sequence was tested on a moving anthropomorphic silicone heart phantom where the 
      coronary arteries were filled with a gadolinium contrast agent solution, and
      imaging was performed at varying heart rates using GRAPPA. The clinical relevance
      of the phantom was validated by comparing the myocardial relaxation times of the 
      phantom's homogeneous silicone cardiac wall to those of humans. Signal-to-noise
      ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio were higher when parallel imaging was used,
      possibly benefiting from the acquisition of one partition per heartbeat. Another 
      advantage of parallel imaging for visualizing the coronary arteries is that the
      entire heart can be imaged within a few breath-holds.

TI  - Methanol content of grappa made from New York grape pomace.
PG  - 3923-5
AB  - This research was undertaken to determine the methanol content of grappa made
      from the sweet pomace of five grape varieties grown in the Finger Lakes wine
      region of New York state. The mean concentrations of methanol (N=3) in the
      distilled spirits made from the pomace samples of Niagara, Cayuga White,
      Gewurztraminer, Chardonnay, and Riesling grapes were estimated to be 44, 38, 138,
      55, and 112 mg/100mL of 40% alcohol, respectively. The results of this work
      indicate that the sweet pomace of five New York grape varieties could be used in 
      the production of grappa with a methanol level within the United States legal
      limit of 280 mg/100mL of 40% alcohol.

TI  - 3.0 Tesla high spatial resolution contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      angiography (CE-MRA) of the pulmonary circulation: initial experience with a
      32-channel phased array coil using a high relaxivity contrast agent.
PG  - 392-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the technical feasibility of high spatial resolution
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) with highly accelerated
      parallel acquisition at 3.0 T using a 32-channel phased array coil, and a high
      relaxivity contrast agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult healthy volunteers (5
      men, 5 women, aged 21-66 years) underwent high spatial resolution CE-MRA of the
      pulmonary circulation. Imaging was performed at 3 T using a 32-channel phase
      array coil. After intravenous injection of 1 mL of gadobenate dimeglumine
      (Gd-BOPTA) at 1.5 mL/s, a timing bolus was used to measure the transit time from 
      the arm vein to the main pulmonary artery. Subsequently following intravenous
      injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-BOPTA at the same rate, isotropic high spatial
      resolution data sets (1 x 1 x 1 mm3) CE-MRA of the entire pulmonary circulation
      were acquired using a fast gradient-recalled echo sequence (TR/TE 3/1.2
      milliseconds, FA 18 degrees) and highly accelerated parallel acquisition (GRAPPA 
      x 6) during a 20-second breath hold. The presence of artifact, noise, and image
      quality of the pulmonary arterial segments were evaluated independently by 2
      radiologists. Phantom measurements were performed to assess the signal-to-noise
      ratio (SNR). Statistical analysis of data was performed by using Wilcoxon rank
      sum test and 2-sample Student t test. The interobserver variability was tested by
      kappa coefficient. RESULTS: All studies were of diagnostic quality as determined 
      by both observers. The pulmonary arteries were routinely identified up to
      fifth-order branches, with definition in the diagnostic range and excellent
      interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.90).
      Phantom measurements showed significantly lower SNR (P < 0.01) using GRAPPA (17.3
      +/- 18.8) compared with measurements without parallel acquisition (58 +/- 49.4). 
      CONCLUSION: The described 3 T CE-MRA protocol in addition to high T1 relaxivity
      of Gd-BOPTA provides sufficient SNR to support highly accelerated parallel
      acquisition (GRAPPA x 6), resulting in acquisition of isotopic (1 x 1 x 1 mm3)
      voxels over the entire pulmonary circulation in 20 seconds.

TI  - Spectral phase-corrected GRAPPA reconstruction of three-dimensional echo-planar
      spectroscopic imaging (3D-EPSI).
PG  - 815-20
AB  - MR spectroscopic (MRS) images from a large volume of brain can be obtained using 
      a 3D echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (3D-EPSI) sequence. However, routine
      applications of 3D-EPSI are still limited by a long scan time. In this
      communication, a new approach termed "spectral phase-corrected generalized
      autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions" (SPC-GRAPPA) is introduced for
      the reconstruction of 3D-EPSI data to accelerate data acquisition while
      preserving the accuracy of quantitation of brain metabolites. In SPC-GRAPPA,
      voxel-by-voxel spectral phase alignment between metabolite 3D-EPSI from
      individual coil elements is performed in the frequency domain, utilizing the
      whole spectrum from interleaved water reference 3D-EPSI for robust estimation of 
      the zero-order phase correction. The performance of SPC-GRAPPA was compared with 
      that of fully encoded 3D-EPSI and conventional GRAPPA. Analysis of whole-brain
      3D-EPSI data reconstructed by SPC-GRAPPA demonstrates that SPC-GRAPPA with an
      acceleration factor of 1.5 yields results very similar to those obtained by fully
      encoded 3D-EPSI, and is more accurate than conventional GRAPPA.

TI  - Volatile components of grape pomaces from different cultivars of Sicilian Vitis
      vinifera L.
PG  - 260-8
AB  - The volatile components of grape pomace coming from the processing of some of the
      most important varieties of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivated in Sicily,
      namely Nero d'Avola, Nerello Mascalese, Frappato and Cabernet Sauvignon, have
      been determined by gas-chromatography (GC) and gas-chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (GC-MS). According to the winemaking procedure that entails the
      removal of stalks before fermentation, two kinds of grape pomace are obtained.
      The first consists of skins, pulp residues and seeds, the proper grape pomace,
      which is partially used for grappa, a typical Italian spirit, and alcohol
      production, the second consists almost exclusively of stalks. On the whole, 38
      components have been characterized in the samples of grape pomaces, with Frappato
      cv. showing the richest composition; instead, 88 components have been detected in
      the stalks of Frappato, Nero d'Avola, Nerello Mascalese and Cabernet Sauvignon
      varieties. In order to make a comparison between the grape varieties easier, the 
      volatile components detected in the two sets of samples (grape pomaces and
      stalks) have been grouped in different classes. Significant differences among
      varieties have been detected and statistical treatment of data is also reported. 
      This study is part of a wider project aimed at the possible exploitation of the
      main agro-industrial by-products. At the same time it is one of the first reports
      on the volatile components of this waste material.

TI  - Accelerated proton echo planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) using GRAPPA with a 
      32-channel phased-array coil.

AB  - Parallel imaging has been demonstrated to reduce the encoding time of MR
      spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Here we investigate up to 5-fold acceleration of 2D
      proton echo planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) at 3T using generalized
      autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) with a 32-channel coil
      array, 1.5 cm(3) voxel size, TR/TE of 15/2000 ms, and 2.1 Hz spectral resolution.
      Compared to an 8-channel array, the smaller RF coil elements in this 32-channel
      array provided a 3.1-fold and 2.8-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in
      the peripheral region and the central region, respectively, and more spatial
      modulated information. Comparison of sensitivity-encoding (SENSE) and GRAPPA
      reconstruction using an 8-channel array showed that both methods yielded similar 
      quantitative metabolite measures (P > 0.1). Concentration values of
      N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI),
      and the sum of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) for both methods were consistent
      with previous studies. Using the 32-channel array coil the mean Cramer-Rao lower 
      bounds (CRLB) were less than 8% for NAA, tCr, and Cho and less than 15% for mI
      and Glx at 2-fold acceleration. At 4-fold acceleration the mean CRLB for NAA,
      tCr, and Cho was less than 11%. In conclusion, the use of a 32-channel coil array
      and GRAPPA reconstruction can significantly reduce the measurement time for
      mapping brain metabolites.

AB  - The sorption of copper(II) on a solid, iminodiacetic based, chelating material,
      the Empore membrane, in alcoholic solutions is considered. Determination of the
      acid-base properties, kinetic of metal sorption and complexing properties, in
      solutions with different percentages of ethanol, ranging from 0 to 40% is
      undertaken. The results are compared with those obtained using the classical
      iminodiacetic resin Chelex 100 in beads. No significant differences are found in 
      the thermodynamic properties, but the kinetics of the metal sorption on the
      membrane is slower and a dependence of the process rate with the alcoholic
      content is observed. In the present investigation, the detection of copper(II)
      species both in alcoholic Italian distillate "grappa" and in its intermediate
      product ("flemma"), is carried out by the Resin Titration (RT) method using, as
      competitive reagent, the Empore membrane. To validate the procedure, synthetic
      solutions containing different percentages of ethanol are analysed.

TI  - Role of echocardiography and cardiac MRI in depicting morphological and
      functional imaging findings useful for diagnosing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 197-210
LID - 10.1007/s11547-010-0603-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a hereditary disease characterised 
      by primary hypertrophy of the left and/or right ventricle. The reference standard
      for imaging diagnosis is echocardiography. The aim of our study was to
      prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography and cardiac
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with HCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-two consecutive patients with a known diagnosis of HCM were prospectively 
      evaluated, with echocardiography and cardiac MR imaging performed within 2 weeks 
      of each other (mean interval 7 days, range 2-14 days). Two experienced
      radiologists blinded to the previous clinical and imaging findings separately
      reviewed the images. The following parameters were calculated for both
      techniques: myocardial mass, wall thickness, end-diastolic volume (EDV),
      end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), systolic anterior motion (SAM)
      of the mitral valve and degree of myocardial fibrosis (based on the ultrasonic
      reflectivity at echocardiography and degree of late enhancement at cardiac MR
      imaging). The statistical correlation was calculated with Student's t test,
      Spearman coefficient and Fisher's exact test. A value of p<0.05 was considered
      significant. RESULTS: The diagnosis of HCM was confirmed in all patients with
      both techniques, with absolute agreement in terms of the site of disease. The
      mean value of myocardial mass presented a statistically significant difference
      between the two techniques (114 g, p<0.001). In contrast, a nonsignificant
      difference between echocardiography and cardiac MR imaging was found for EDV (102
      ml vs 111 ml; p=0.31), ESV (30 ml vs 38 ml; p=0.1), EF (74% vs 68%, p=0.5), SAM
      (p=0.1) and myocardial fibrosis (p=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac MR imaging
      correlates well with echocardiography in defining the morphological and
      functional parameters useful for the imaging diagnosis of HCM and therefore, in
      selected cases (poor acoustic window, doubtful echocardiography findings), it may
      be a valid alternative to echocardiography.

TI  - Influence of specific fermentation conditions on natural microflora of pomace in 
      "Grappa" production.
PG  - 1747-59
LID - 10.1007/s11274-011-0989-7 [doi]
AB  - As reported in the European Community regulation, grappa is a spirit beverage
      made in Italy from marc that has been steam distilled or distilled after the
      addition of water. Grape marc from red grapes has already undergone alcoholic
      fermentation with the must and can be distilled immediately. Grape marc from
      white grapes does not contain ethanol but contains sugars that are fermented by
      spontaneous anaerobic fermentation during a storage period. The characteristic
      aroma of grappa consists of a large number of volatile compounds, which arise
      from various sources, the most important of which is yeast. Very few studies have
      been undertaken to characterize the natural populations of yeast during the
      fermentation of grape marc. The goal of this study was to understand how
      different pHs, temperatures and yeast starter cultures affect the growth and
      dynamics of yeast species involved in pomace fermentation, which could be the
      basis for improving the final quality of grappa production. We found that a
      temperature of 15 degrees C has the greatest effect on improving the quality of
      the product. Unfortunately, due to the solid state of the grape marc and the
      impossibility of its mixing, it appears that acidification and the addition of
      yeast starter cultures during the silage period are not effective.

TI  - Effects of grape marcs acidification treatment on the evolution of indigenous
      yeast populations during the production of grappa.
PG  - 382-8

AB  - AIMS: Grappa is a typical Italian product obtained from the distillation of grape
      marcs, the main by-product of grape crushing. One technological treatment
      frequently performed on marcs is their acidification, in order to contrast the
      development of unwanted spoilage bacteria during the storage period needed for
      alcoholic fermentation. A pilot-scale experiment was set-up to study the dynamics
      of yeast populations during a 30-day fermentation of acidified and nonacidified
      Prosecco grape pomace. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saccharomyces cerevisiae population, 
      examined after 4 and 15 days of storage by mitochondrial DNA-RFLP analysis,
      resulted considerably different at strain level upon acidification. In
      particular, although the number of different strains rescued appeared
      particularly high in both kind of marcs compared with what happens in must
      fermentation, in the acidified material such number tends to moderately decrease 
      during storage. CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained evidence that the acidification
      treatment did not influence yeast population neither in terms of number of cells 
      nor in terms of biodiversity at species level. Therefore, such treatment can be
      used in distillery without negatively influencing ethanol production.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Even though some data are available on the
      effects of technological treatments on the chemical composition of the
      distillate, no microbiological studies have been published so far on the
      consequence of these practices on composition, biodiversity and evolution of
      yeast population.

AB  - Nowadays grape marc represents one of the main by-product of winemaking. Many
      South Europe countries valorize this ligno-cellulosic waste through fermentation 
      and distillation for industrial alcoholic beverage production. The storage of
      marcs is a crucial phase in the distillation process, due to the physicochemical 
      transformations ascribed to microbial activity. Among the methods adopted by
      distillers to improve the quality of spirits, the use of selected yeasts has not 
      been explored so far, therefore in this work we evaluated the selection criteria 
      of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for grape marc fermentation. The proposed
      selection procedure included three steps: characterization of phenotypical
      traits, evaluation of selected strains on pasteurised grape marc at lab-scale
      (100 g) and pilot-scale fermentation (350 kg). This selection process was applied
      on 104 strains isolated from grape marcs of different origins and technological
      treatment. Among physiological traits, beta-glucosidase activity level as quality
      trait seems to be only partially involved in increasing varietal flavour. More
      effective in describing yeast impact on distillate quality is the ratio higher
      alcohols/esters that indicates strain ability to increase positive flavours.
      Finally, evaluating grape marc as source of selected yeasts, industrial treatment
      rather than varietal origin seems to shape strain technological and quality
      traits.

AB  - In Mediterranean countries the most diffuse practice to obtain the valorization
      of grape marc, the main by-product from winemaking, is the production of spirits.
      During this process, marc storage for sugar fermentation represents a crucial
      step, since side-fermentations leading to off-flavours production can very easily
      occur. In this study we evaluated the effect of the addition of two yeast
      strains, inoculated separately at the beginning of the storage period, into marcs
      from two Italian grape varieties with the aim to control the development of
      autochthonous microbiota and to improve spirit quality. The presence of the
      inoculated strains was monitored by means of PCR-based approaches. A commercial
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, chosen as this species is notably the best
      ethanol producer, showed excellent ability to dominate the autochthonous
      microflora and to reduce off-flavours as demonstrated by chemical analysis and
      sensory evaluation. A Saccharomycodes ludwigii strain, chosen for increasing
      varietal compounds thus enhancing spirit aroma, showed a level of implantation
      not sufficient to assure a clear beneficial effect on quality. The implantation
      level of this strain was affected by S. cerevisiae competition since the highest 
      level was found in grape marc with lower sugar content, where indigenous S.
      cerevisiae were less persistent.

AB  - Acetaldehyde is a naturally-occurring carcinogenic compound, present in different
      food items, especially in alcoholic beverages. The aims of this study were to
      measure acetaldehyde concentration in different beverages consumed in Italy and
      to estimate the potential cancer risk. The analytical procedure was based on
      headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (GC-MS), using the isotopic dilution method. The margin of exposure 
      (MOE) approach of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was used for risk
      characterisation. The highest concentrations (median, min-max) were detected in
      grappa samples (499, 23.4-1850mg/l), followed by fruit-based liqueurs and spirits
      (62.0, 5.23-483mg/l) and wine (68.0, 18.1-477mg/l); the lowest were detected in
      gin (0.91, 0.78-1.90mg/l). The lowest MOE was estimated for high wine consumers
      (69). These results suggest that regulatory measures and consumer guidance may be
      necessary for acetaldehyde in beverages.

TI  - Sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 317507
LID - 10.1155/2015/317507 [doi]
AB  - SGLT2 inhibitors are new antihyperglycaemic agents whose ability to lower glucose
      is directly proportional to GFR. Therefore, in chronic kidney disease (CKD) the
      blood glucose lowering effect is reduced. Unlike many current therapies, the
      mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of insulin action or
      beta-cell function. In addition, the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is
      complementary and not alternative to other antidiabetic agents. SGLT2 inhibitors 
      could be potentially effective in attenuating renal hyperfiltration and,
      consequently, the progression of CKD. Moreover, the reductions in intraglomerular
      pressure, systemic blood pressure, and uric acid levels induced by SGLT
      inhibition may potentially be of benefit in CKD subjects without diabetes.
      However, at present, only few clinical studies were designed to evaluate the
      effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD. Consequently, safety and potential efficacy
      beyond blood glucose lowering should be better clarified in CKD. In this paper we
      provide an updated review of the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice,
      with particular attention on subjects with CKD.

AB  - This article describes a nano-scale method for the determination and
      quantification of five benzodiazepines (BDZ) in an alcoholic grappa drink
      (chlordiazepoxide; lorazepam; diazepam; oxazepam; medazepam). BDZ are typically
      used in drug-facilitated crimes (DFC) for their accessibility and synergistic
      effects with alcohol. Specimens collected on the crime scene must be rapidly
      analyzed to prove the crime, though, in most cases, a very small amount is
      available. Off-line MEPS extraction of diluted grappa samples proved to be an
      efficient and reliable method for the recovery of the selected compounds.
      Requiring a very small amount of extraction solvents, MEPS is an
      environment-friendly technique. LC separation with UV detection was used as the
      analytical technique because it is simple, robust, relatively economic and
      easy-to-find in most laboratories. The method was validated in terms of
      precision, accuracy and recovery. Limits of detection and quantitation were in
      the range of 0.5-2ng/muL. Linearity (R(2)) spanned from 0.9994 and 1.0000. Intra-
      and inter-day repeatabilities were lower than 12% at any concentration. Recovery 
      percentages of an equivalent-to-real sample at three different concentrations
      were between 70.7 and 74.1%.

PG  - 27-35
AB  - A drinking study on the pharmacokinetics of the typical grappa congeners
      2-butanol and 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone) was performed. It was expected
      that the concentration ratio might provide a means to estimate the time of
      ingestion of a grappa beverage. Twelve subjects drank a volume of the grappa
      "Vecchio di Prosecco" (42 vol%) to reach a blood alcohollevel of 1.20 %o. In the 
      congener analyses in serum, a median 2-butanol concentration of 0.79 mg/1 (range 
      0.45-1.34 mg/1) and of 1.01 mg/I (0.44-1.62 mg/1) for 2-butanone were measured.
      The concentration-time curve was biphasic starting with a slow and plateau-like
      elimination. However, considerable inter-individual differences were observed.
      Only in 3 subjects, a 2-butanol : 2-butanone ratio below 1 suggested ingestion
      within the last 6 hours. The majority of the subjects exhibited higher
      concentrations of 2-butanone than of 2-butanol such that the ratio was always
      smaller than 1. According to the present results the concentrations of 2-butanol 
      and 2-butanone or their ratio do not provide a reliable basis to draw conclusions
      on the time of grappa ingestion.

TI  - Sub-muscular Breast Augmentation Using Tumescent Local Anesthesia.
PG  - 7-13
LID - 10.1007/s00266-018-1181-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) consists of infiltration of saline
      solution with lidocaine and epinephrine into the tissues to obtain regional
      anesthesia and vasoconstriction. The use of TLA in augmentation mammoplasty has
      been described for sub-glandular positioning. We describe a modified TLA
      technique for primary sub-muscular breast augmentation reporting our experience
      during the past 7 years. METHODS: From 2010 to 2017, 300 patients underwent
      bilateral primary sub-muscular breast augmentation under TLA and conscious
      sedation. The tumescent solution was prepared with 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq
      of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9%
      saline solution. Firstly, the solution was infiltrated between the pectoral
      fascia and the mammary gland, secondarily, during surgery, under the pectoralis
      major muscle. RESULTS: The average amount of tumescent solution infiltrated while
      performing TLA was 740 mL per breast. No signs of adrenaline or lidocaine
      toxicity were reported and conversion to general anesthesia was never required.
      In all patients, no pain nor discomfort was reported during the pre-operating
      infiltration and surgical procedure. We reported a major complication rate of
      3.3% (4 hematomas and 6 seromas) and a minor complication rate of 6.0% (8 implant
      dislocation and 10 dystrophic scars formation). CONCLUSIONS: TLA represents a
      safe and efficacious technique for performing breast augmentation surgery with
      sub-muscular implant positioning. This technique guarantees good pain control
      during and after surgery and has low incidence of postoperative side effects.
      Patients subjected to sub-muscular breast augmentation with TLA were satisfied.

AB  - A 22-year-old woman presented with methanol toxicity manifesting as headache,
      reduced conscious state and visual change after consuming home-made grappa. She
      progressed to a coma with fixed mydriasis and severe acidaemia (pH 6.55). She was
      treated with empirical antidote administration (intravenous ethanol) and enhanced
      elimination through haemodialysis. She survived despite her delayed presentation 
      but developed significant neurological sequelae, including visual impairment. We 
      provide an overview of key elements of diagnosis and recent updates in treatment 
      recommendations.

TI  - Plants in alcoholic beverages on the Croatian islands, with special reference to 
      rakija travarica.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/s13002-019-0332-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper aims to record the species used for flavouring and making 
      alcoholic drinks, mainly rakija, on the islands of the Adriatic (Croatia).
      METHODS: Our data comes from 295 interviews performed on 36 islands, in both the 
      Dalmatian and Kvarner areas of the Adriatic. RESULTS: Altogether, 114 species are
      used-46% from wild locations only, 15% both wild and cultivated, 38% only
      cultivated and two species are imported. The most common local alcohol is wine,
      made without spices, but grape pomace distillate is often flavoured with single
      or mixed species. The mix is called travarica. The most commonly used species are
      Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Myrtus communis L., Salvia officinalis L., Ruta
      graveolens L., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Ceratonia siliqua L., Juglans regia L.,
      Citrus spp., Ficus carica L., Laurus nobilis L., Rosmarinus officinalis L.,
      Artemisia absinthium L., Rosa centifolia L., Mentha x piperita L. and M. spicata 
      L. Unfortunately, the widespread phenomenon of distilling Arbutus unedo L. fruits
      and fermenting Juniperus 'wine' is now extinct. Apart from grapes, the only
      commonly distilled fruit now is Ficus carica. CONCLUSIONS: It is striking that
      nearly all the plants are either wild or cultivated locally, which, in addition
      to the fact that the alcohol is made locally, shows the incredible local culinary
      self-sufficiency of the area. The number of species used is also very impressive.

TI  - Changes in volatile compounds of grape pomace distillate (Italian grappa) during 
      one-year ageing in oak and cherry barrels.

AB  - The Italian grape pomace distillate grappa is often refined by ageing in wooden
      barrels. Chemical changes of the volatile profile of two samples produced from a 
      Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot blend and Prosecco pomace both at two ethanol contents 
      (55% and 68%) were studied during one-year ageing in cherry and oak barriques.
      Grappa variety, ethanol content and barrel type strongly affected the volatiles
      profile of the distillates. Oak-aged grappa contained 10-fold the wood volatiles 
      of the cherry-aged one, but the latter had higher levels of syringaldehyde,
      coniferaldehyde, and 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenol; 55% ethanol extracted higher levels 
      of wood compounds and ethoxy-compounds were higher in the 68%-ethanol
      distillates. Prosecco grappa extracted higher wood compounds and showed no
      significant changes in the levels of fruity/floral esters and terpenols. Findings
      of this study can be also useful in the development of new ageing processes of
      distillates for which cherry barrels are still not used (e.g., brandy and
      whisky).

TI  - Systemic allergic reactions induced by labile plant-food allergens: Seeking
      potential cofactors. A multicenter study.
LID - 10.1111/all.14634 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat-and-pepsin-sensitive plant food allergens (PR-10 and profilin)
      sometimes cause systemic reaction. OBJECTIVE: To detect the risk factors for
      systemic reactions induced by labile food allergens. METHODS: A retrospective
      multicenter study was performed on patients with a documented history of systemic
      allergic reaction to labile plant food allergens and on age-matched controls with
      a history of oral allergy syndrome (OAS) induced by the same foods. Offending
      foods, their amount, and state (solid or liquid), and potential cofactors
      (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, protonic pump inhibitors, exercise,
      alcohol, and fasting) were considered. RESULTS: We studied 89 patients and 81
      controls. Sensitization to PR-10 or profilin, IgE to Bet v 1 and/or Bet v 2, and 
      foods causing OAS were similar in the two groups. Twenty patients experienced >1 
      systemic allergic reaction. Tree nuts, Rosaceae, Apiaceae, and soymilk were the
      main offending foods. Seventeen (19%) patients were taking a PPI when the
      systemic reaction occurred (vs 5% in controls; P < .025). The ingestion of the
      offending food in liquid form (soymilk) was frequent among patients (15%) but
      unusual among controls (2%; P < .025). Soy milk-induced systemic reactions were
      independent of PPI treatment. Fasting and excess of allergen, but not NSAID and
      exercise, were other relevant cofactors for systemic reactions. Systemic
      reactions occurred without any identifiable cofactor in 39 (44%) cases.
      CONCLUSION: PR-10- and profilin-induced systemic reactions are facilitated by
      PPI, ingestion of large amounts of unprocessed foods, and fasting. Soybean
      beverages represent a risk for PR-10 hypersensitive patients and should be
      avoided.
