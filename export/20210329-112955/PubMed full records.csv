Clinical and hemodynamic follow-up].;;symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied in order to evaluate the effect of long term sympathetic beta-blockade with metoprolol. Clinical evaluation, stress test, two-dimensional echocardiography, 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiography and hemodynamic assessment with Swan-Ganz catheter were performed before enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to the  relative placebo (8 pts) or metoprolol group (12 pts) in a single-blind fashion.  The placebo group received standard therapy (digitalis, diuretics, vasodilators and anticoagulants as needed), while the metoprolol group, along with standard therapy received low-dose beta-blockade, starting with 6.25 mg twice daily and then doubling every 4 days on the two daily administrations. The therapeutic end-point was 100 mg. Patients received less than 100 mg if their systolic blood  pressure was less than 100 mmHg or if their resting heart rate was less than 55 beats/min. Patients were clinically assessed every month and a 24-hour electrocardiography, echocardiography and hemodynamic control was repeated after  six months. In the metoprolol group there was one sudden death and two drop-outs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);;Cucchini F, Compostella L, Papalia D, de Domenico R, Iavernaro A, Zeppellini R;;ita;['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Cardiac Catheterization', 'Cardiomyopathy, Dilated/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metoprolol/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Time Factors'];;;;
2;8921456;Article;1996;International journal of epidemiology;;Validity and reproducibility of alcohol consumption in Italy.;;BACKGROUND: The reproducibility and validity of alcohol consumption has not been  adequately studied, particularly in mediterranean countries, where alcohol drinking is a widespread habit, especially during meals. METHODS: We compared alcohol consumption measured by two interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) with average intake derived from two 7-day dietary (7-DD) records (the reference method) on 395 volunteers. Different types of alcoholic beverages were considered separately in order to verify the ability of the questionnaire to assess detailed patterns of alcohol intake. RESULTS: A satisfactory level of reproducibility and validity of the pattern of alcohol consumption across different levels and types of alcoholic beverage intake was observed. The reproducibility of wine and total alcohol intake showed correlation coefficients > 0.75 in both sexes. The validity was somewhat higher for wine (around 0.70) than for other alcoholic beverages and total alcohol intake. This is probably accounted for by the more regular pattern of wine consumption during  the year as compared to other alcoholic beverages (beer, grappa, etc) which are more strongly influenced by seasonal and daily variations. However, about 30% of  abstainers according to FFQ were drinkers by the reference method. The opposite was observed in only 4% of subjects. CONCLUSION: The FFQ is a reliable and valid  instrument for collecting alcohol intake in regular drinkers. Lower validity in irregular drinkers may be due to seasonal variation and/or inadequacy of the FFQ  to capture irregular patterns of consumption and/or inadequacy of the average of  two 7-DD as a reference method. Furthermore, a considerable degree of misclassification was observed between non-drinkers and moderate drinkers.;;Ferraroni M, Decarli A, Franceschi S, La Vecchia C, Enard L, Negri E, Parpinel M, Salvini S;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking/*epidemiology', 'Beer', '*Diet Records', '*Diet Surveys', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sex Factors', 'Wine'];;;;10.1093/ije/25.4.775
3;9849424;Article;1998;European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990);;Alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer: a multicentre Italian case-control study.;;The relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk was investigated using data from a co-operative case-control study conducted in Italy between 1991 and 1994 on 2569 incident, histologically confirmed breast cancer cases and 2588 controls in hospital for acute, non-neoplastic, non-hormone related conditions. Overall, 915 (38%) cases and 1048 (43%) controls were abstainers. Compared with them, the odds ratio (OR), adjusted only for age, was 1.31 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.53) for drinkers and became 1.39 (95% CI 1.(1)21-1.60) after correction for measurement error. The multivariate OR was  1.21 for drinkers of < or = 5.87 g/day and 1.23, 1.19, 1.21, 1.41 for drinkers of 5.88-13.40, 13.41-24.55, 24.56-27.60, > 27.60 g/day, respectively. The trend in risk was significant (chi 2 = 12.28, P < 0.0005). The association was apparently  stronger in premenopausal women (OR = 1.80 for > 27.60 g/day). Considering the different types of alcoholic beverages (wine, beer, digestives, grappa and other  spirits), a significant direct trend in breast cancer risk was seen for wine with an OR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.06-1.53) for the category > 26.34 g/day. The ORs were also above unity for beer, grappa, digestives and spirits drinkers. No appreciable interaction was observed between alcohol drinking and body mass index, smoking, or any other covariate considered. Thus, the present data, based  on a validated alcohol consumption questionnaire and on a population characterised by a relatively high alcohol consumption in women, confirmed that alcohol drinking is moderately related to breast cancer risk. If causal, this association could explain 12% (95% CI, 5-19%) of breast cancers in Italy, thus representing one of the major avoidable risk factor for breast cancer.;;Ferraroni M, Decarli A, Franceschi S, La Vecchia C;;eng;['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Postmenopause', 'Premenopause', 'Risk Factors'];;;;10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00163-4
4;12530773;Article;2001;European journal of epidemiology;;Alcohol, smoking, coffee and risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction in Italy.;;OBJECTIVES: To assess the relation between cigarette smoking, alcohol, coffee, decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption, and the risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN AND SETTING: Hospital-based case-control study conducted in 1995-1999 in Milan, Italy. PATIENTS: 507 cases with a first episode of non-fatal AMI, and 478 controls admitted to hospital for acute diseases. METHODS: Information was collected by interviewer-administered questionnaires. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Compared to alcohol non-drinkers the OR was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-0.9) in drinkers, and 0.5 in drinkers of > 3 drinks/day. The OR for > 1 drink/day of wine was 0.5, and those for beer, amari, grappa and spirits ranged between 0.4 and 0.6. Compared to never smokers,  the OR was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5-3.1) among current smokers, and 4.6 among current smokers of > or = 25 cigarettes/day. The risk was similar to that of never smokers > or = 5 years after cessation (OR: 1.1 after 5-9 years, 0.7 after > or = 10 years). The OR was 2.3 for low tar cigarettes and 2.0 for high tar ones. The OR for coffee intake (expresso and mocha) was around unity up to 3 cups/ day, but rose to 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.3) for > or = 6 cups/ day. Moderate decaffeinated coffee and tea intake was not associated with AMI risk. Compared to non-smokers drinking < or = 3 cups of coffee/day, the OR was 1.6 among non-smokers drinking > 3 cups of coffee/ day and 3.3 (95% CI: 2.1-5.0) among current smokers drinking <  or = 3 cups of coffee/day. Compared to alcohol drinkers with a coffee intake of < or = 3 cups/ day, alcohol non-drinkers with higher coffee intake had an OR of 2.2, and compared to non-smokers alcohol drinkers, the OR was 3.3 in current smokers alcohol non-drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: In this Italian population alcohol intake was inversely associated to AMI risk, while smoking and heavy (but not moderate) coffee drinking increased the risk.;;Tavani A, Bertuzzi M, Negri E, Sorbara L, La Vecchia C;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects/epidemiology', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Coffee/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/epidemiology'];;;;10.1023/a:1021276932160
5;11588899;Article;2001;Nutrition and cancer;;Coffee and alcohol intake and risk of ovarian cancer: an Italian case-control study.;;"The relation between coffee and alcohol intake and ovarian cancer risk was analyzed in a case-control study conducted in Italy between 1992 and 1999. Cases  were 1,031 women, aged 18-79 years, with incident, histologically confirmed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, and controls were 2,411 women, aged 17-79 years, admitted to the hospital for acute nonneoplastic non-hormone-related diseases. Coffee intake (mostly espresso and mocha) was not associated with ovarian cancer risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.93 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.69-1.27] in drinkers of > or = 4 cups/day compared with drinkers of < 1  cup/day. No meaningful relation was observed with cappuccino (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.85-1.32 for drinkers compared with nondrinkers), decaffeinated coffee (OR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96), and tea intake (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.75-1.08). Total alcohol intake was not associated with ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.76-1.57 in drinkers of > or = 36 g/day compared with never drinkers). No relationship was found with wine (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.70-1.50 for > 39 g/day compared with never drinkers), beer, amari, grappa, and spirits. No significant heterogeneity was found for coffee or total alcohol intake across strata of age,  education, parity, oral contraceptive use, family history of ovarian/breast cancer, body mass index, and calorie intake.

Annual Conference;;Partially parallel MR spectroscopic imaging of gliomas at 3T.;;Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has been used to more accurately  diagnose, localize, and assess progression and treatment response for gliomas. The main limitation of the MRSI is the long data acquisition times. A current approach is to reduce the amount of k-space data sampled by limiting the data acquisition to a central elliptical portion of k-space. This study investigated the feasibility of reducing the data acquisition time further for the MRSI data using two parallel imaging techniques and investigating the relative performance  of sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA).;;Ozturk E, Banerjee S, Majumdar S, Nelson SJ;;eng;['Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Brain/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Choline/analysis', 'Creatine/analysis', 'Glioma/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity'];;;P50 CA9729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259793
8;17540280;Article;2007;Magnetic resonance imaging;;Parallel imaging for first-pass myocardial perfusion.;;Two parallel imaging methods used for first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging were compared in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and image artifacts. One used adaptive Time-adaptive SENSitivity Encoding (TSENSE) and the other used GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA), which are both applied to a gradient-echo sequence. Both methods were tested on 12 patients with coronary artery disease. The order of perfusion sequences was inverted in every other patient. Image acquisition was started during the administration of a contrast bolus followed by a 20-ml saline  flush (3 ml/s), and the next perfusion was started at least 15 min thereafter using an identical bolus. An acceleration rate of 2 was used in both methods, and acquisition was performed during breath-holding. Significantly higher SNR, CNR and image quality were obtained with GRAPPA images than with TSENSE images. GRAPPA, however, did not yield a higher CNR when applied after the second bolus.  GRAPPA perfusion imaging produced larger differences between subjects than did TSENSE. Compared to TSENSE, GRAPPA produced significantly better CNR on the first bolus. More consistent SNR and CNR were obtained from TSENSE images than from GRAPPA images, indicating that the diagnostic value of TSENSE may be better.;;Irwan R, Lubbers DD, van der Vleuten PA, Kappert P, Gotte MJ, Sijens PE;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Artifacts', 'Contrast Media/administration & dosage', 'Coronary Disease/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Meglumine/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Organometallic Compounds/administration & dosage'];;;;10.1016/j.mri.2006.10.012

The technique is based on fast low-angle shot and uses fat saturation and magnetization transfer contrast prepulses to improve image contrast. GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) is implemented to shorten acquisition time. The sequence was tested on a moving anthropomorphic silicone heart phantom where the  coronary arteries were filled with a gadolinium contrast agent solution, and imaging was performed at varying heart rates using GRAPPA. The clinical relevance of the phantom was validated by comparing the myocardial relaxation times of the  phantom's homogeneous silicone cardiac wall to those of humans. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio were higher when parallel imaging was used, possibly benefiting from the acquisition of one partition per heartbeat. Another  advantage of parallel imaging for visualizing the coronary arteries is that the entire heart can be imaged within a few breath-holds.;;Irwan R, Russel IK, Sijens PE;;eng;['Contrast Media', 'Coronary Angiography/*methods', 'Coronary Vessels/*anatomy & histology', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods', 'Meglumine', 'Motion', 'Organometallic Compounds', 'Phantoms, Imaging'];;;;10.1016/j.mri.2006.03.003

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult healthy volunteers (5 men, 5 women, aged 21-66 years) underwent high spatial resolution CE-MRA of the pulmonary circulation. Imaging was performed at 3 T using a 32-channel phase array coil. After intravenous injection of 1 mL of gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) at 1.5 mL/s, a timing bolus was used to measure the transit time from  the arm vein to the main pulmonary artery. Subsequently following intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-BOPTA at the same rate, isotropic high spatial resolution data sets (1 x 1 x 1 mm3) CE-MRA of the entire pulmonary circulation were acquired using a fast gradient-recalled echo sequence (TR/TE 3/1.2 milliseconds, FA 18 degrees) and highly accelerated parallel acquisition (GRAPPA  x 6) during a 20-second breath hold. The presence of artifact, noise, and image quality of the pulmonary arterial segments were evaluated independently by 2 radiologists. Phantom measurements were performed to assess the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Statistical analysis of data was performed by using Wilcoxon rank sum test and 2-sample Student t test. The interobserver variability was tested by kappa coefficient. RESULTS: All studies were of diagnostic quality as determined  by both observers. The pulmonary arteries were routinely identified up to fifth-order branches, with definition in the diagnostic range and excellent interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.90). Phantom measurements showed significantly lower SNR (P < 0.01) using GRAPPA (17.3 +/- 18.8) compared with measurements without parallel acquisition (58 +/- 49.4).  CONCLUSION: The described 3 T CE-MRA protocol in addition to high T1 relaxivity of Gd-BOPTA provides sufficient SNR to support highly accelerated parallel acquisition (GRAPPA x 6), resulting in acquisition of isotopic (1 x 1 x 1 mm3) voxels over the entire pulmonary circulation in 20 seconds.;;Nael K, Fenchel M, Krishnam M, Finn JP, Laub G, Ruehm SG;;eng;['Adult', 'Aged', 'Artifacts', 'Contrast Media/pharmacokinetics', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography/*methods', 'Male', 'Meglumine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Organometallic Compounds/pharmacokinetics', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Prospective Studies', '*Pulmonary Circulation', 'Statistics, Nonparametric'];;;;10.1097/01.rli.0000261937.77365.6a

However, routine applications of 3D-EPSI are still limited by a long scan time. In this communication, a new approach termed ""spectral phase-corrected generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions"" (SPC-GRAPPA) is introduced for the reconstruction of 3D-EPSI data to accelerate data acquisition while preserving the accuracy of quantitation of brain metabolites. In SPC-GRAPPA, voxel-by-voxel spectral phase alignment between metabolite 3D-EPSI from individual coil elements is performed in the frequency domain, utilizing the whole spectrum from interleaved water reference 3D-EPSI for robust estimation of  the zero-order phase correction. The performance of SPC-GRAPPA was compared with  that of fully encoded 3D-EPSI and conventional GRAPPA. Analysis of whole-brain 3D-EPSI data reconstructed by SPC-GRAPPA demonstrates that SPC-GRAPPA with an acceleration factor of 1.5 yields results very similar to those obtained by fully encoded 3D-EPSI, and is more accurate than conventional GRAPPA.";;Zhu X, Ebel A, Ji JX, Schuff N;;eng;['Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Creatine/metabolism', 'Echo-Planar Imaging/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Middle Aged'];;;AG10897/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;10.1002/mrm.21217

According to the winemaking procedure that entails the removal of stalks before fermentation, two kinds of grape pomace are obtained. The first consists of skins, pulp residues and seeds, the proper grape pomace, which is partially used for grappa, a typical Italian spirit, and alcohol production, the second consists almost exclusively of stalks. On the whole, 38 components have been characterized in the samples of grape pomaces, with Frappato cv. showing the richest composition; instead, 88 components have been detected in the stalks of Frappato, Nero d'Avola, Nerello Mascalese and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties. In order to make a comparison between the grape varieties easier, the  volatile components detected in the two sets of samples (grape pomaces and stalks) have been grouped in different classes. Significant differences among varieties have been detected and statistical treatment of data is also reported.

Here we investigate up to 5-fold acceleration of 2D proton echo planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) at 3T using generalized autocalibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) with a 32-channel coil array, 1.5 cm(3) voxel size, TR/TE of 15/2000 ms, and 2.1 Hz spectral resolution.

Comparison of sensitivity-encoding (SENSE) and GRAPPA reconstruction using an 8-channel array showed that both methods yielded similar  quantitative metabolite measures (P > 0.1). Concentration values of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), and the sum of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) for both methods were consistent with previous studies. Using the 32-channel array coil the mean Cramer-Rao lower  bounds (CRLB) were less than 8% for NAA, tCr, and Cho and less than 15% for mI and Glx at 2-fold acceleration. At 4-fold acceleration the mean CRLB for NAA, tCr, and Cho was less than 11%.

The reference standard for imaging diagnosis is echocardiography. The aim of our study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with HCM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients with a known diagnosis of HCM were prospectively  evaluated, with echocardiography and cardiac MR imaging performed within 2 weeks  of each other (mean interval 7 days, range 2-14 days). Two experienced radiologists blinded to the previous clinical and imaging findings separately reviewed the images. The following parameters were calculated for both techniques: myocardial mass, wall thickness, end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction (EF), systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and degree of myocardial fibrosis (based on the ultrasonic reflectivity at echocardiography and degree of late enhancement at cardiac MR imaging). The statistical correlation was calculated with Student's t test, Spearman coefficient and Fisher's exact test. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The diagnosis of HCM was confirmed in all patients with both techniques, with absolute agreement in terms of the site of disease. The mean value of myocardial mass presented a statistically significant difference between the two techniques (114 g, p<0.001). In contrast, a nonsignificant difference between echocardiography and cardiac MR imaging was found for EDV (102 ml vs 111 ml; p=0.31), ESV (30 ml vs 38 ml; p=0.1), EF (74% vs 68%, p=0.5), SAM (p=0.1) and myocardial fibrosis (p=0.15).

17;22805957;Article;2012;World journal of microbiology & biotechnology;;"Influence of specific fermentation conditions on natural microflora of pomace in  ""Grappa"" production.";;As reported in the European Community regulation, grappa is a spirit beverage made in Italy from marc that has been steam distilled or distilled after the addition of water. Grape marc from red grapes has already undergone alcoholic fermentation with the must and can be distilled immediately. Grape marc from white grapes does not contain ethanol but contains sugars that are fermented by spontaneous anaerobic fermentation during a storage period. The characteristic aroma of grappa consists of a large number of volatile compounds, which arise from various sources, the most important of which is yeast. Very few studies have been undertaken to characterize the natural populations of yeast during the fermentation of grape marc. The goal of this study was to understand how different pHs, temperatures and yeast starter cultures affect the growth and dynamics of yeast species involved in pomace fermentation, which could be the basis for improving the final quality of grappa production. We found that a temperature of 15 degrees C has the greatest effect on improving the quality of the product. Unfortunately, due to the solid state of the grape marc and the impossibility of its mixing, it appears that acidification and the addition of yeast starter cultures during the silage period are not effective.;;Iacumin L, Manzano M, Cecchini F, Orlic S, Zironi R, Comi G;;eng;['Beverages/*microbiology', '*Biodiversity', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis', 'Fermentation', 'Fungi/*classification/genetics/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Italy', 'Molecular Typing', 'Mycological Typing Techniques', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Temperature', 'Vitis/*microbiology'];;;;10.1007/s11274-011-0989-7
18;21615635;Article;2011;Journal of applied microbiology;;Effects of grape marcs acidification treatment on the evolution of indigenous yeast populations during the production of grappa.;;AIMS: Grappa is a typical Italian product obtained from the distillation of grape marcs, the main by-product of grape crushing. One technological treatment frequently performed on marcs is their acidification, in order to contrast the development of unwanted spoilage bacteria during the storage period needed for alcoholic fermentation. A pilot-scale experiment was set-up to study the dynamics of yeast populations during a 30-day fermentation of acidified and nonacidified Prosecco grape pomace. METHODS AND RESULTS: Saccharomyces cerevisiae population,  examined after 4 and 15 days of storage by mitochondrial DNA-RFLP analysis, resulted considerably different at strain level upon acidification. In particular, although the number of different strains rescued appeared particularly high in both kind of marcs compared with what happens in must fermentation, in the acidified material such number tends to moderately decrease  during storage. CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained evidence that the acidification treatment did not influence yeast population neither in terms of number of cells  nor in terms of biodiversity at species level. Therefore, such treatment can be used in distillery without negatively influencing ethanol production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Even though some data are available on the effects of technological treatments on the chemical composition of the distillate, no microbiological studies have been published so far on the consequence of these practices on composition, biodiversity and evolution of yeast population.;;Bovo B, Giacomini A, Corich V;;eng;['Acids/*metabolism', 'Alcoholic Beverages/*microbiology', 'Biodiversity', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer/genetics', 'Ethanol', '*Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Phylogeny', 'Population Dynamics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*growth & development', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Vitis/*microbiology'];;;;10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05060.x
19;25475330;Article;2015;Food microbiology;;Outlining a selection procedure for Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from grape  marc to improve fermentation process and distillate quality.;;Nowadays grape marc represents one of the main by-product of winemaking. Many South Europe countries valorize this ligno-cellulosic waste through fermentation  and distillation for industrial alcoholic beverage production. The storage of marcs is a crucial phase in the distillation process, due to the physicochemical  transformations ascribed to microbial activity. Among the methods adopted by distillers to improve the quality of spirits, the use of selected yeasts has not  been explored so far, therefore in this work we evaluated the selection criteria  of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for grape marc fermentation. The proposed selection procedure included three steps: characterization of phenotypical traits, evaluation of selected strains on pasteurised grape marc at lab-scale (100 g) and pilot-scale fermentation (350 kg). This selection process was applied on 104 strains isolated from grape marcs of different origins and technological treatment. Among physiological traits, beta-glucosidase activity level as quality trait seems to be only partially involved in increasing varietal flavour. More effective in describing yeast impact on distillate quality is the ratio higher alcohols/esters that indicates strain ability to increase positive flavours. Finally, evaluating grape marc as source of selected yeasts, industrial treatment rather than varietal origin seems to shape strain technological and quality traits.;;Bovo B, Carlot M, Fontana F, Lombardi A, Soligo S, Giacomini A, Corich V;;eng;['Distillation', 'Fermentation', 'Food Microbiology/*methods', 'Humans', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Taste', 'Vitis/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Wine/*analysis/microbiology'];['Biodiversity', 'By-product', 'GC/MS analysis', 'Higher alcohols', 'mtDNA-RFLP'];;;10.1016/j.fm.2014.10.001
20;24750811;Article;2014;Food microbiology;;Exploring the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae commercial strain and Saccharomycodes ludwigii natural isolate for grape marc fermentation to improve sensory properties of spirits.;;In Mediterranean countries the most diffuse practice to obtain the valorization of grape marc, the main by-product from winemaking, is the production of spirits. During this process, marc storage for sugar fermentation represents a crucial step, since side-fermentations leading to off-flavours production can very easily occur. In this study we evaluated the effect of the addition of two yeast strains, inoculated separately at the beginning of the storage period, into marcs from two Italian grape varieties with the aim to control the development of autochthonous microbiota and to improve spirit quality. The presence of the inoculated strains was monitored by means of PCR-based approaches. A commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, chosen as this species is notably the best ethanol producer, showed excellent ability to dominate the autochthonous microflora and to reduce off-flavours as demonstrated by chemical analysis and sensory evaluation. A Saccharomycodes ludwigii strain, chosen for increasing varietal compounds thus enhancing spirit aroma, showed a level of implantation not sufficient to assure a clear beneficial effect on quality. The implantation level of this strain was affected by S. cerevisiae competition since the highest  level was found in grape marc with lower sugar content, where indigenous S. cerevisiae were less persistent.;;Bovo B, Carlot M, Lombardi A, Lomolino G, Lante A, Giacomini A, Corich V;;eng;['Fermentation', 'Flavoring Agents/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*metabolism', 'Saccharomycetales/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Taste', 'Vitis/chemistry/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Wine/analysis/*microbiology'];['Aromatic compounds', 'Distillate quality', 'Grappa', 'ITS-RFLP analysis', 'Molecular characterization', 'Non-Saccharomyces'];;;10.1016/j.fm.2014.01.006

The aims of this study were to measure acetaldehyde concentration in different beverages consumed in Italy and to estimate the potential cancer risk. The analytical procedure was based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using the isotopic dilution method. The margin of exposure  (MOE) approach of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was used for risk characterisation. The highest concentrations (median, min-max) were detected in grappa samples (499, 23.4-1850mg/l), followed by fruit-based liqueurs and spirits (62.0, 5.23-483mg/l) and wine (68.0, 18.1-477mg/l); the lowest were detected in gin (0.91, 0.78-1.90mg/l).

22;25785281;Article;2015;TheScientificWorldJournal;;Sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease.;;SGLT2 inhibitors are new antihyperglycaemic agents whose ability to lower glucose is directly proportional to GFR. Therefore, in chronic kidney disease (CKD) the blood glucose lowering effect is reduced. Unlike many current therapies, the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is independent of insulin action or beta-cell function. In addition, the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors is complementary and not alternative to other antidiabetic agents. SGLT2 inhibitors  could be potentially effective in attenuating renal hyperfiltration and, consequently, the progression of CKD. Moreover, the reductions in intraglomerular pressure, systemic blood pressure, and uric acid levels induced by SGLT inhibition may potentially be of benefit in CKD subjects without diabetes. However, at present, only few clinical studies were designed to evaluate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD. Consequently, safety and potential efficacy beyond blood glucose lowering should be better clarified in CKD. In this paper we provide an updated review of the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice, with particular attention on subjects with CKD.;;Zanoli L, Granata A, Lentini P, Rastelli S, Fatuzzo P, Rapisarda F, Castellino P;;eng;['Animals', 'Canagliflozin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Diabetic Nephropathies/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2', '*Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors', 'Sorbitol/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use'];;;;10.1155/2015/317507

BDZ are typically used in drug-facilitated crimes (DFC) for their accessibility and synergistic effects with alcohol. Specimens collected on the crime scene must be rapidly analyzed to prove the crime, though, in most cases, a very small amount is available. Off-line MEPS extraction of diluted grappa samples proved to be an efficient and reliable method for the recovery of the selected compounds. Requiring a very small amount of extraction solvents, MEPS is an environment-friendly technique. LC separation with UV detection was used as the analytical technique because it is simple, robust, relatively economic and easy-to-find in most laboratories. The method was validated in terms of precision, accuracy and recovery. Limits of detection and quantitation were in the range of 0.5-2ng/muL. Linearity (R(2)) spanned from 0.9994 and 1.0000.

It was expected that the concentration ratio might provide a means to estimate the time of ingestion of a grappa beverage. Twelve subjects drank a volume of the grappa ""Vecchio di Prosecco"" (42 vol%) to reach a blood alcohollevel of 1.20 %o. In the  congener analyses in serum, a median 2-butanol concentration of 0.79 mg/1 (range  0.45-1.34 mg/1) and of 1.01 mg/I (0.44-1.62 mg/1) for 2-butanone were measured. The concentration-time curve was biphasic starting with a slow and plateau-like elimination. However, considerable inter-individual differences were observed. Only in 3 subjects, a 2-butanol : 2-butanone ratio below 1 suggested ingestion within the last 6 hours. The majority of the subjects exhibited higher concentrations of 2-butanone than of 2-butanol such that the ratio was always smaller than 1.

25;29995233;Article;2019;Aesthetic plastic surgery;;Sub-muscular Breast Augmentation Using Tumescent Local Anesthesia.;;BACKGROUND: Tumescent local anesthesia (TLA) consists of infiltration of saline solution with lidocaine and epinephrine into the tissues to obtain regional anesthesia and vasoconstriction. The use of TLA in augmentation mammoplasty has been described for sub-glandular positioning. We describe a modified TLA technique for primary sub-muscular breast augmentation reporting our experience during the past 7 years. METHODS: From 2010 to 2017, 300 patients underwent bilateral primary sub-muscular breast augmentation under TLA and conscious sedation. The tumescent solution was prepared with 25 mL of 2% lidocaine, 8 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 mL of epinephrine (1 mg/1 mL) in 1000 mL of 0.9% saline solution. Firstly, the solution was infiltrated between the pectoral fascia and the mammary gland, secondarily, during surgery, under the pectoralis major muscle. RESULTS: The average amount of tumescent solution infiltrated while performing TLA was 740 mL per breast. No signs of adrenaline or lidocaine toxicity were reported and conversion to general anesthesia was never required. In all patients, no pain nor discomfort was reported during the pre-operating infiltration and surgical procedure. We reported a major complication rate of 3.3% (4 hematomas and 6 seromas) and a minor complication rate of 6.0% (8 implant dislocation and 10 dystrophic scars formation). CONCLUSIONS: TLA represents a safe and efficacious technique for performing breast augmentation surgery with sub-muscular implant positioning. This technique guarantees good pain control during and after surgery and has low incidence of postoperative side effects. Patients subjected to sub-muscular breast augmentation with TLA were satisfied. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

METHODS: Our data comes from 295 interviews performed on 36 islands, in both the  Dalmatian and Kvarner areas of the Adriatic. RESULTS: Altogether, 114 species are used-46% from wild locations only, 15% both wild and cultivated, 38% only cultivated and two species are imported. The most common local alcohol is wine, made without spices, but grape pomace distillate is often flavoured with single or mixed species. The mix is called travarica. The most commonly used species are Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Myrtus communis L., Salvia officinalis L., Ruta graveolens L., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Ceratonia siliqua L., Juglans regia L., Citrus spp., Ficus carica L., Laurus nobilis L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Artemisia absinthium L., Rosa centifolia L., Mentha x piperita L. and M. spicata  L. Unfortunately, the widespread phenomenon of distilling Arbutus unedo L. fruits and fermenting Juniperus 'wine' is now extinct. Apart from grapes, the only commonly distilled fruit now is Ficus carica. CONCLUSIONS: It is striking that nearly all the plants are either wild or cultivated locally, which, in addition to the fact that the alcohol is made locally, shows the incredible local culinary self-sufficiency of the area.

OBJECTIVE: To detect the risk factors for systemic reactions induced by labile food allergens. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was performed on patients with a documented history of systemic allergic reaction to labile plant food allergens and on age-matched controls with a history of oral allergy syndrome (OAS) induced by the same foods. Offending foods, their amount, and state (solid or liquid), and potential cofactors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, protonic pump inhibitors, exercise, alcohol, and fasting) were considered. RESULTS: We studied 89 patients and 81 controls. Sensitization to PR-10 or profilin, IgE to Bet v 1 and/or Bet v 2, and  foods causing OAS were similar in the two groups. Twenty patients experienced >1  systemic allergic reaction. Tree nuts, Rosaceae, Apiaceae, and soymilk were the main offending foods. Seventeen (19%) patients were taking a PPI when the systemic reaction occurred (vs 5% in controls; P < .025). The ingestion of the offending food in liquid form (soymilk) was frequent among patients (15%) but unusual among controls (2%; P < .025). Soy milk-induced systemic reactions were independent of PPI treatment. Fasting and excess of allergen, but not NSAID and exercise, were other relevant cofactors for systemic reactions. Systemic reactions occurred without any identifiable cofactor in 39 (44%) cases. CONCLUSION: PR-10- and profilin-induced systemic reactions are facilitated by PPI, ingestion of large amounts of unprocessed foods, and fasting.
